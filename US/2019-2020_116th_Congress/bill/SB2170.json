In developing these rate maps, FEMA must use the most current remote sensing technology. In coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, FEMA must establish a digital database to display the flood hazard risks of buildings in NFIP. The database must contain specified information about each property, including a certification of the building's elevation. FEMA must provide a one-time premium credit for the purchase of an elevation certificate by a policyholder. The bill allows reimbursement to local governments that assist FEMA in developing flood risk zone data.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-18","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9493,"person_hash":"cabmgf99","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Roger Wicker","first_name":"Roger","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Wicker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MS","ftm_eid":17659028,"votesmart_id":21926,"opensecrets_id":"N00003280","knowwho_pid":158928,"ballotpedia":"Roger_Wicker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3872","sast_bill_id":1271850},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2187","sast_bill_id":1271693}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13189,"subject_name":"Floods and storm protection"},{"subject_id":321582,"subject_name":"Geography and mapping"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047510,"date":"2019-07-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2170\/id\/2047510","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2170\/BILLS-116s2170is.pdf","text_size":369423,"text_hash":"7d6bee6c978a85abc9bccb7ec2909ad8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
