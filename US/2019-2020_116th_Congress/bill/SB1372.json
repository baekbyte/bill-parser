PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain PFAS, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. Upon state request, federal departments or agencies must expedite cooperative agreements with states to address the contamination\u2014or suspected contamination\u2014of drinking water, surface water, groundwater, land surface, or subsurface strata (e.g., rock or soil). The cooperative agreements must meet or exceed the most stringent of the standards enumerated in the bill.

have not been finalized or amended, and (2) projected timelines for finalizing the agreements.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public
