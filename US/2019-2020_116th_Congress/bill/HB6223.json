(A blocked crossing is a circumstance in which a train, railroad car, or locomotive engine is stopped or is standing in a manner that obstructs public travel at a crossing). Specifically, the bill requires each railroad carrier to collect data on blocked crossings and directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to incorporate such data into the national highway-rail crossing inventory; establishes a 10-minute limit on trains, locomotive, railroad cars, or other railroad equipment blocking crossings, with specified exceptions; authorizes DOT to issue civil penalties for each incident where a crossing is blocked by a standing train, locomotive, or rail equipment; requires DOT to issue regulations defining what is considered persistently or egregiously blocking a crossing, including taking into consideration the extent to which the blocked crossing poses a public safety hazard; does not apply to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) or commuter authorities; directs DOT to issue and publish a national strategy on how it plans to address blocked crossings; and requires each railroad carrier to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone service for rights-of-way over which it dispatches trains to directly receive calls reporting blocked crossings.","pending_committee_id":2527,"committee":{"committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-03-13","committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9027,"person_hash":"5fj074kg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Cooper","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cooper","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-5","ftm_eid":17658367,"votesmart_id":48891,"opensecrets_id":"N00003132","knowwho_pid":211701,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Cooper_(Tennessee)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9019,"person_hash":"lcudj1xk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andre Carson","first_name":"Andre","middle_name":"","last_name":"Carson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-7","ftm_eid":17658782,"votesmart_id":84917,"opensecrets_id":"N00029513","knowwho_pid":263260,"ballotpedia":"Andr%C3%A9_Carson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13585,"subject_name":"Congressional officers and employees"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177131,"date":"2020-04-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6223\/id\/2177131","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6223\/BILLS-116hr6223ih.pdf","text_size":341042,"text_hash":"fd6f6d95c0332e92308c9c8a1539b435"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
