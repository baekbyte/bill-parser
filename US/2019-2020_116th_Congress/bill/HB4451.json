Specifically, the bill expands eligibility for such assistance to caregivers of veterans who have a serious illness that was incurred or aggravated during active military, naval, or air service. Under current law, such assistance is already provided to caregivers of veterans who sustained serious injuries in the course of their military, naval, or air service. The bill also requires the provision of an annual multidimensional assessment to measure burdens felt by family caregivers who are designated as the primary providers of personal care services to such veterans.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-20","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-11-08","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-20","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15236,"person_hash":"krtaqpow","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Ruiz","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ruiz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-36","ftm_eid":17657757,"votesmart_id":136407,"opensecrets_id":"N00033510","knowwho_pid":291125,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Ruiz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9058,"person_hash":"klc5fkcs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Higgins","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Higgins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-26","ftm_eid":4689854,"votesmart_id":23127,"opensecrets_id":"N00027060","knowwho_pid":197797,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Higgins","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18299,"person_hash":"iadbtvth","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Val Demings","first_name":"Val","middle_name":"Butler","last_name":"Demings","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-10","ftm_eid":69035,"votesmart_id":137637,"opensecrets_id":"N00033449","knowwho_pid":378538,"ballotpedia":"Val_Demings","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9213,"person_hash":"86i58pyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Cole","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cole","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-4","ftm_eid":14964187,"votesmart_id":46034,"opensecrets_id":"N00025726","knowwho_pid":211693,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cole_(Oklahoma)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20059,"person_hash":"xs2edxvf","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Fletcher","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"Pannill","last_name":"Fletcher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-7","ftm_eid":44045104,"votesmart_id":177031,"opensecrets_id":"N00041194","knowwho_pid":625330,"ballotpedia":"Lizzie_Pannill_Fletcher","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20754,"subject_name":"Family services"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2057308,"date":"2019-10-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4451\/id\/2057308","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4451\/BILLS-116hr4451ih.pdf","text_size":343960,"text_hash":"975260c4dd6f596bd1f9c4496fca7cd1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
