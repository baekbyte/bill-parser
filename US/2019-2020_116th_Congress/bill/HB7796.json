Among other things, debt collectors may not during this period enforce a security interest through a repossession, seize assets, commence or continue an eviction, terminate utility service, or charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment. After this period, debt collectors must provide certain repayment options including extending the repayment period for debts. The bill also provides for forbearance programs established by creditors for consumers experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19. The Federal Reserve Board must establish a credit facility to make long-term, low-cost loans to these creditors for losses caused by any forbearance of payments.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-27","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14082,"person_hash":"7db3fndh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joyce Beatty","first_name":"Joyce","middle_name":"","last_name":"Beatty","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-3","ftm_eid":2954872,"votesmart_id":2427,"opensecrets_id":"N00033904","knowwho_pid":197852,"ballotpedia":"Joyce_Beatty","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9144,"person_hash":"ijja8k71","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Maxine Waters","first_name":"Maxine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-43","ftm_eid":1257359,"votesmart_id":26759,"opensecrets_id":"N00006690","knowwho_pid":158752,"ballotpedia":"Maxine_Waters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6800","sast_bill_id":1365578}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13808,"subject_name":"Alternative dispute resolution, mediation, arbitration"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":81071,"subject_name":"Debt collection"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205890,"date":"2020-08-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7796\/id\/2205890","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7796\/BILLS-116hr7796ih.pdf","text_size":312151,"text_hash":"eecd39cadb08ad9301c437962782152a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
