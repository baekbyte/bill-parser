It also recognizes that the lack of vaccination can create an environment in which a public health crisis could emerge, and that there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause life-threatening or disabling diseases in healthy children or adults. The resolution also encourages a continued commitment to vaccine research, and urges everyone to follow the scientific evidence and consensus of medical experts in favor of timely vaccinations.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
