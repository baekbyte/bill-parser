Specifically, it makes a student loan borrower who is an employee and founder of a start-up eligible for deferment and cancellation of student loans. In addition, the bill makes a full-time employee of a start-up eligible for cancelation of student loan debt. It also excludes from an individual's gross income, for income tax purposes, the amount of such canceled student loan debt. Finally, it establishes a young entrepreneurs business center within the Small Business Administration to certify small business start-ups, identify distressed areas, and approve loan cancellations. To be certified by the center, a start-up must (1) have a founder who is a recent graduate of a four-year IHE, and (2) employ a certain number of recent graduates.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Small Business, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Small Business, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Small Business, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8955,"person_hash":"zy55u68d","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nydia Velazquez","first_name":"Nydia","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Velazquez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-7","ftm_eid":17658223,"votesmart_id":26975,"opensecrets_id":"N00001102","knowwho_pid":158981,"ballotpedia":"Nydia_Velazquez","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9128,"person_hash":"ypyg7okp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jose Serrano","first_name":"Jose","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Serrano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-15","ftm_eid":17391438,"votesmart_id":26981,"opensecrets_id":"N00001813","knowwho_pid":158985,"ballotpedia":"Jose_Serrano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20072,"person_hash":"teprewup","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Katie Hill","first_name":"Katie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hill","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-25","ftm_eid":44044404,"votesmart_id":179354,"opensecrets_id":"N00040644","knowwho_pid":618828,"ballotpedia":"Katie_Hill","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20071,"person_hash":"jtfybl9j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chrissy Houlahan","first_name":"Chrissy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Houlahan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-6","ftm_eid":44045003,"votesmart_id":178893,"opensecrets_id":"N00040949","knowwho_pid":621721,"ballotpedia":"Chrissy_Houlahan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1862124,"date":"2019-01-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB231\/id\/1862124","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr231\/BILLS-116hr231ih.pdf","text_size":139096,"text_hash":"18bed5fd379147eac659ff423328b77a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
