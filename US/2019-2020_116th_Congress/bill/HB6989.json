Specifically, the bill prohibits certain transactions such as acquisitions (1) by firms with over $100 million in revenue; (2) by financial institutions or equity funds with over $100 million in capitalization; and (3) involving firms with exclusive patents pertaining to COVID-19 pandemic-related production, manufacturing, distribution, or infrastructure. However, a waiver may be granted if the participating firms demonstrate that the transaction will advance critical national security, economic, or public health interests during the emergency. Further, the bill establishes a legal presumption against a transaction that may pose a risk to the government's ability to respond to the national emergency declared due to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-22","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20089,"person_hash":"bo9op4iq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","first_name":"Alexandria","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ocasio-Cortez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-14","ftm_eid":43884749,"votesmart_id":180416,"opensecrets_id":"N00041162","knowwho_pid":624858,"ballotpedia":"Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20061,"person_hash":"hgpd80bs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jesus Garcia","first_name":"Jesus","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garcia","suffix":"","nickname":"Chuy","district":"HD-IL-4","ftm_eid":28299070,"votesmart_id":6261,"opensecrets_id":"N00042114","knowwho_pid":645347,"ballotpedia":"Jesus_Garcia","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20090,"person_hash":"32tjrlyp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ilhan Omar","first_name":"Ilhan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Omar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-5","ftm_eid":40606750,"votesmart_id":171628,"opensecrets_id":"N00043581","knowwho_pid":583510,"ballotpedia":"Ilhan_Omar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4013","sast_bill_id":1370864}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13614,"subject_name":"Intellectual property"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13727,"subject_name":"Product development and innovation"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13945,"subject_name":"Strategic materials and reserves"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2194427,"date":"2020-06-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6989\/id\/2194427","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6989\/BILLS-116hr6989ih.pdf","text_size":315810,"text_hash":"a4d6c946fce020c7967000e8c024c735"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
