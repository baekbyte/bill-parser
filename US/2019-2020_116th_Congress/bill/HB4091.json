The bill expands the goals of ARPA-E to include the development of energy technologies that (1) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (2) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy. ARPA-E must ensure that it does not provide grants for projects unless the prospective grantees demonstrate sufficient attempts to secure private financing or indicate that the projects are not independently commercially viable. The bill also authorizes DOE to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate how well ARPA-E is achieving its goals and missions.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-30","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"},{"date":"2019-09-10","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-30","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
