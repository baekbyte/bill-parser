Under the model, rural hospitals receive fixed, monthly payments from all participating payers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers) for inpatient and outpatient services (rather than on a fee-for-service basis). In order to participate, hospitals must conduct a community health needs assessment survey and submit a transformation plan that incorporates the survey results and includes other specified information relating to the global payment model, including targeted populations, types of services, and anticipated Medicare savings.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-18","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6962","sast_bill_id":1367033}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13763,"subject_name":"Community life and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047484,"date":"2019-07-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2157\/id\/2047484","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2157\/BILLS-116s2157is.pdf","text_size":375716,"text_hash":"9a0d3a54751ed830cacb308a873a3619"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
