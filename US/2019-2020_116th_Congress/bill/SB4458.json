It also reallocates certain other funding to jurisdictions for such public health measures. The additional amounts provided by the bill are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) and the Senate PAYGO rule, which excludes the budget effects from being counted for purposes of enforcing the PAYGO rules. In particular, the bill authorizes the formation of interstate compacts of states, tribes, and territories to procure COVID-19 tests and supplies, and it specifically reserves a portion of funding for jurisdictions that join compacts that meet requirements for transparency, governance, anti-corruption, and timeliness of test results. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must also support the formation of, and cooperate with, these compacts. The bill also provides additional funding, and reallocates existing funding, specifically for contact tracing and other public health measures. To recieve such funding, a jurisdiction must submit a plan, developed with relevant stakeholders, to HHS that details how it will suppress COVID-19 to levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS must provide guidance and undertake other efforts to coordinate these plans, such as by developing shared indicators. HHS must report within 30 days to Congress concerning the timeline for the distribution of these funds.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-05","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9255,"person_hash":"8t4a6t34","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bill Cassidy","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cassidy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":6673315,"votesmart_id":69494,"opensecrets_id":"N00030245","knowwho_pid":266763,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Cassidy","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15348,"person_hash":"ov53d9s8","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Angus King","first_name":"Angus","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"King","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":1792907,"votesmart_id":22381,"opensecrets_id":"N00034580","knowwho_pid":209655,"ballotpedia":"Angus_King","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9425,"person_hash":"dayilu15","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thomas Carper","first_name":"Thomas","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Carper","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-DE","ftm_eid":8428238,"votesmart_id":22421,"opensecrets_id":"N00012508","knowwho_pid":205484,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Carper","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB7958","sast_bill_id":1375534}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206987,"date":"2020-09-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4458\/id\/2206987","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4458\/BILLS-116s4458is.pdf","text_size":319008,"text_hash":"0fea257f5ffa7a11af2ef62c71e16ae7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
