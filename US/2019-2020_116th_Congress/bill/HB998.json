The bill eliminates the 2% fee that the federal government currently deducts from a state's share to cover administrative or other costs. On request of a state, the Department of the Interior must convey to the state a property interest in the state's share of royalties and other payments from public land or mineral deposits located in the state. Interior must provide prompt notice of any such conveyance and the duty of the leaseholder to make direct payments to the state.","pending_committee_id":2367,"committee":{"committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-06","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-22","committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18296,"person_hash":"7pw2lpla","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Liz Cheney","first_name":"Liz","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cheney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WY","ftm_eid":15475560,"votesmart_id":171319,"opensecrets_id":"N00035504","knowwho_pid":464230,"ballotpedia":"Liz_Cheney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19403,"person_hash":"dr9bgbef","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Greg Gianforte","first_name":"Greg","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Gianforte","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MT","ftm_eid":7734214,"votesmart_id":168594,"opensecrets_id":"N00040733","knowwho_pid":574195,"ballotpedia":"Greg_Gianforte","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11054,"person_hash":"9av89gbt","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Gosar","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Gosar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-4","ftm_eid":8461058,"votesmart_id":123491,"opensecrets_id":"N00030771","knowwho_pid":283933,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Gosar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14902,"person_hash":"tzhhvy6i","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Meadows","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Meadows","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-11","ftm_eid":5904346,"votesmart_id":136459,"opensecrets_id":"N00033631","knowwho_pid":378689,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Meadows_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9228,"person_hash":"ytoqefw4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Duncan Hunter","first_name":"Duncan","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Hunter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-50","ftm_eid":17658760,"votesmart_id":104308,"opensecrets_id":"N00029258","knowwho_pid":272496,"ballotpedia":"Duncan_Hunter","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16473,"person_hash":"687vmrnw","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dan Newhouse","first_name":"Dan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Newhouse","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-4","ftm_eid":2971537,"votesmart_id":51522,"opensecrets_id":"N00036403","knowwho_pid":211847,"ballotpedia":"Dan_Newhouse","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB218","sast_bill_id":1172945},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4294","sast_bill_id":1274301}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13417,"subject_name":"Energy revenues and royalties"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1915232,"date":"2019-02-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB998\/id\/1915232","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr998\/BILLS-116hr998ih.pdf","text_size":279132,"text_hash":"f76abcbab2c110868dac20f7eb21cbb5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
