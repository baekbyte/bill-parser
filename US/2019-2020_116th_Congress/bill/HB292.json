Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to establish a voluntary program whereby states or Indian tribes may opt-in to an agreement allowing them to take on the responsibility of environmental review for the permitting of broadband projects. Such projects must be located within an operational right-of-way (all real property interests acquired for the construction or operation of a project) on (1) national forest system land, (2) land managed by Interior, or (3) Indian lands. USDA and Interior shall also establish broadband permit streamlining teams to coordinate and expedite permitting decisions for broadband projects.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-08","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"},{"date":"2019-02-08","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19436,"person_hash":"4ggjmoax","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Curtis","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Curtis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-3","ftm_eid":6444263,"votesmart_id":123390,"opensecrets_id":"N00041221","knowwho_pid":626323,"ballotpedia":"John_Curtis_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9269,"person_hash":"swa3u5tf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Virginia Foxx","first_name":"Virginia","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foxx","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-5","ftm_eid":6285984,"votesmart_id":6051,"opensecrets_id":"N00026166","knowwho_pid":196515,"ballotpedia":"Virginia_Foxx","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13379,"subject_name":"Indian lands and resources rights"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1868802,"date":"2019-01-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB292\/id\/1868802","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr292\/BILLS-116hr292ih.pdf","text_size":261832,"text_hash":"2c352f272376bb745f60f05ecabf7b8c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
