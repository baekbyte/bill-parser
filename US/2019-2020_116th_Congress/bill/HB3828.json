Specifically, DOE must accelerate the development of commercially viable carbon capture technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, including to improve the thermodynamics, kinetics, scalability, durability, and flexibility of carbon capture technologies used during the generation of electricity from natural gas power systems; enter into cooperative agreements with certain entities to construct and operate no more than five facilities to capture carbon dioxide from natural gas generating power facilities; and identify any barriers to the commercial development of carbon capture technologies.","pending_committee_id":2313,"committee":{"committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And
