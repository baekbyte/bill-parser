The bill revises the process for environmental reviews of natural gas projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) must prepare a supplement to a draft or final environmental impact statement if (1) FERC makes a substantial change in the proposed action that is relevant to environmental concerns, or (2) there are significant new circumstances relevant to environmental concerns. FERC must also hold public meetings in each county (or equivalent subdivision) in which a project is to be located. Additionally, in an environmental impact statement, an evaluation of the visual impacts of a project on a national scenic trail must include a cumulative analysis of the visual impacts of the project and similar proposed projects.","pending_committee_id":2933,"committee":{"committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
