Specifically, the bill repeals the authorizations for the use of miltary force enacted in 2002 against Iraq and in 2001 in response to the September 11 terror attacks. To receive expedited consideration, a bill or resolution that is authorizing, narrowing, or repealing the use of military force must provide a specific strategic objective for military action; a specification that the military force is necessary, appropriate, and proportional to the purpose of the authorization; a list of named nations, organizations, or forces engaged in active hostilities against the United States; a specification of the country, countries, or subdivisions thereof in which military force is to be authorized; and a date certain for the duration of the authorization, not to exceed two years. The bill also establishes an expedited procedure for Congress to consider such a narrowing or repeal, and it prohibits the use of appropriations to support military force in hostilities outside the parameters of an authorization. Lastly, the resolution requires the President, when requesting an authorization for the use of military force, to provide a comprehensive justification for such request by including (1) the nations, organizations, and forces covered; (2) the countries and subdivisions of such countries covered; and (3) the duration of the request.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-24","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18293,"person_hash":"vidnqcls","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brown","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-4","ftm_eid":5017996,"votesmart_id":19344,"opensecrets_id":"N00036999","knowwho_pid":195317,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SJR60","sast_bill_id":1280328}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13359,"subject_name":"Conflicts and wars"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13150,"subject_name":"Defense spending"},{"subject_id":13447,"subject_name":"Iraq"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13448,"subject_name":"Middle East"},{"subject_id":13449,"subject_name":"Military operations and strategy"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13465,"subject_name":"War and emergency powers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2122181,"date":"2020-02-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HJR83\/id\/2122181","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hjres83\/BILLS-116hjres83ih.pdf","text_size":331686,"text_hash":"d05f7b1f9cff498e3a72ecd6ed2c865f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
