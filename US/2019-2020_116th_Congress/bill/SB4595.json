Specifically, if such a J-1 visa expires during the two-month period before this bill's enactment or the 90-day period after, the visa shall remain valid until the end of the 90-day period. The Department of Homeland Security may deny an extension on a case-by-case basis if it (1) determines that extending a particular visa would pose a national security risk, and (2) explains the reasons for the determination to Congress.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-16","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13191,"subject_name":"Foreign labor"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":332087,"subject_name":"U.S. Agency for Global Media"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2211151,"date":"2020-10-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4595\/id\/2211151","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4595\/BILLS-116s4595is.pdf","text_size":295006,"text_hash":"f06ff4441ce57226f6cb406ee8926134"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
