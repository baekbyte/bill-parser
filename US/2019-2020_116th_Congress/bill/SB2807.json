Specifically, certified programs must undergo periodic surveys by a state, local, or approved accreditation agency, as specified; the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide joint training for surveyors and programs, and must publish information relating to survey results on the Hospice Compare website. Surveyors must provide programs with educational materials to help them correct any found deficiencies. If the CMS finds that a program does not meet applicable standards, the CMS may impose intermediate sanctions, including suspended Medicare payments, temporary management, and additional training; such programs must also undergo more frequent surveys until they are found to be in compliance.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-07","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11966,"person_hash":"d5cx9z5s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rob Portman","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Portman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3094681,"votesmart_id":27008,"opensecrets_id":"N00003682","knowwho_pid":159002,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Portman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9441,"person_hash":"m9ujezsn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Benjamin Cardin","first_name":"Benjamin","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Cardin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":8046162,"votesmart_id":26888,"opensecrets_id":"N00001955","knowwho_pid":158887,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Cardin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9212,"person_hash":"l1ed938k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Shelley Capito","first_name":"Shelley","middle_name":"Moore","last_name":"Capito","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WV-2","ftm_eid":6651319,"votesmart_id":11701,"opensecrets_id":"N00009771","knowwho_pid":200084,"ballotpedia":"Shelley_Moore_Capito","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2069463,"date":"2019-11-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2807\/id\/2069463","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2807\/BILLS-116s2807is.pdf","text_size":336396,"text_hash":"32afcceb117c788c89c42ee485b5cc49"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
