Specifically, a plan or provider may not charge an enrollee more than the in-network amount for services that are emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider or at an out-of-network facility; nonemergency services provided at an in-network facility by an out-of-network provider; or nonemergency services provided out-of-network to an enrollee who initially enters through an emergency room for emergency services, except under specified circumstances. Additionally, health insurance plans must pay the median in-network amount, minus the enrollee's in-network cost-sharing amount, directly to a health care provider. The bill also establishes an independent review process to resolve billing disputes between insurance plans and providers.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And
