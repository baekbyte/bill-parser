Such agents and officers shall turn on their cameras for the duration of each shift. The footage shall be available to each party in any administrative proceeding, civil action, or criminal proceeding where such footage is pertinent. An agent or officer whose camera does not record footage during a shift shall be subject to furlough, reduction in pay or grade, or suspension. When a camera does not record during a shift, the Department of Homeland Security may not determine that the camera malfunctioned unless the agent or officer submits evidence to establish that a malfunction occurred.
