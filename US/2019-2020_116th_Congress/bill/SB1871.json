A \"transportation network company\" is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers affiliated with the entity to transport the rider using a vehicle owned, leased, or otherwise authorized for use by the driver to a point chosen by the rider. States must require TNC drivers to display (1) a front and rear license plate; (2) a scannable quick response or similar code on the windows for riders to verify that they are entering the correct authorized vehicle; and (3) illuminated signs that are visible in both day and night, and readable from fifty feet. Drivers must also get periodic safety inspections of their ride-hailing vehicle. The bill prohibits the sale of illuminated TNC vehicle signs by any person other than a transportation network company and the display of such signs by individuals who are not authorized drivers.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9441,"person_hash":"m9ujezsn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Benjamin Cardin","first_name":"Benjamin","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Cardin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":8046162,"votesmart_id":26888,"opensecrets_id":"N00001955","knowwho_pid":158887,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Cardin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9423,"person_hash":"mswz9g79","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Dianne Feinstein","first_name":"Dianne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Feinstein","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":26294,"votesmart_id":53273,"opensecrets_id":"N00007364","knowwho_pid":165201,"ballotpedia":"Dianne_Feinstein","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3262","sast_bill_id":1268462},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4686","sast_bill_id":1276851}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13781,"subject_name":"Assault and harassment offenses"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13429,"subject_name":"Crime prevention"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2041925,"date":"2019-06-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1871\/id\/2041925","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1871\/BILLS-116s1871is.pdf","text_size":263387,"text_hash":"ab04e468add04f969b28ed43b1dd3023"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
