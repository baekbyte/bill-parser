The Department of State shall generally not deny exports, re-exports, or transfers of defense articles or services to or from Cyprus if the request is made by or on behalf of Cyprus and if Cyprus is the end user of such articles or services. However, even if these conditions are met, the State Department may deny such a transfer based on credible human rights concerns. Furthermore, the existing policy to deny exports, re-exports, or transfers of articles on the U.S. Munitions List to Cyprus shall remain in effect unless the President periodically certifies to Congress that Cyprus is (1) cooperating with U.S. efforts to reform anti-money-laundering regulations and financial regulatory oversight, and (2) taking steps to deny Russian military vessels access to ports for refueling and servicing. The President may temporarily waive the export denial policy for U.S. national security interests.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign
