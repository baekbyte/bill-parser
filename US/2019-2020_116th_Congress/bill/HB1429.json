(The program assists public water systems in financing infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and meet health objectives under the Safe Drinking Water Act.) The funding provided by this bill is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The emergency funding is exempt from discretionary spending limits and is only available if the President subsequently designates the amounts as an emergency and submits the designation to Congress. The bill also exempts the funding from sequestration. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)","pending_committee_id":2298,"committee":{"committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Introduced
