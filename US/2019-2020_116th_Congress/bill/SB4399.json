Specifically, the bill requires states and local entities receiving federal housing assistance to submit to HUD, for inclusion in the database, certain information regarding evictions from assisted dwelling units in the past year. Such information must include, among other things, the reason for eviction and whether the household was represented by legal counsel in the proceedings. Additionally, consumer reporting agencies may include an adverse item of information relating to a landlord-tenant action in a consumer report only if the landlord prevailed in the action and the tenant was an adult on the date the court claim was filed. Any such information must be removed from a consumer report one year after the date of the action. Further, the bill authorizes additional Emergency Solutions Grants to provide legal counsel and pay court fees for tenants subject to or at risk of eviction. Finally, HUD must require owners of federally assisted rental units to annually provide information to each tenant regarding the rights and responsibilities of the owner with respect to eviction and local organizations and resources that can provide assistance in eviction-related matters. HUD must also establish an eviction hotline to provide assistance to tenants of these units.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-03","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-03","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7847","sast_bill_id":1374778}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13375,"subject_name":"Housing and community development"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13780,"subject_name":"Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"},{"subject_id":13781,"subject_name":"Assault and harassment offenses"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13158,"subject_name":"Department of Housing and Urban Development"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13660,"subject_name":"Domestic violence and child abuse"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13605,"subject_name":"HIV\/AIDS"},{"subject_id":13217,"subject_name":"Homelessness and emergency shelter"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13221,"subject_name":"Housing for the elderly and disabled"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13261,"subject_name":"Public housing"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206547,"date":"2020-08-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4399\/id\/2206547","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4399\/BILLS-116s4399is.pdf","text_size":317495,"text_hash":"8b0457b549f185ea189e9c400d1240c0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
