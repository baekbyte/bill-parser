An eligible partnership must consist of (1) at least one institution of higher education, (2) at least one individual employer, and (3) a workforce intermediary (an entity that demonstrates expertise in fostering partnerships in order to support postsecondary apprenticeship programs). Such partnership may also include other entities such as a state agency responsible for administering career and technical education, a labor organization, or an economic development agency. ED must not provide a grant to a partnership seeking to establish an apprenticeship in construction trades. A partnership that receives a grant must use the funds to develop and implement a postsecondary apprenticeship program in a high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industry sector or occupation. Additionally, an apprenticeship shall qualify as a work-study program through which a student apprentice is eligible for federal financial assistance.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18314,"person_hash":"mapln5bo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ro Khanna","first_name":"Ro","middle_name":"","last_name":"Khanna","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-17","ftm_eid":373494,"votesmart_id":29473,"opensecrets_id":"N00026427","knowwho_pid":281537,"ballotpedia":"Ro_Khanna","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":17981,"person_hash":"zxhyi8jd","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dwight Evans","first_name":"Dwight","middle_name":"","last_name":"Evans","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-2","ftm_eid":13006152,"votesmart_id":9128,"opensecrets_id":"N00038450","knowwho_pid":198425,"ballotpedia":"Dwight_Evans","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2899","sast_bill_id":1284516}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13125,"subject_name":"Academic performance and assessments"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":20700,"subject_name":"Minority employment"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":81062,"subject_name":"Student records"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":81057,"subject_name":"Vocational and technical education"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13769,"subject_name":"Women's education"},{"subject_id":13327,"subject_name":"Women's employment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2153632,"date":"2020-02-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5961\/id\/2153632","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5961\/BILLS-116hr5961ih.pdf","text_size":340117,"text_hash":"671a0a00b32414e681ede23deff9284b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
