The individual must submit (1) each return filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for any year ending while the individual is President, and (2) each return filed with the IRS for the three years before the individual assumed office. After receiving the returns, the OGE must (1) make the returns publicly available on the Internet, and (2) submit the returns to specified congressional committees. No information may be redacted from the disclosed returns except for (1) Social Security, tax identification, and account identification numbers; and (2) the name of any dependent of the taxpayer. The bill establishes civil and criminal penalties to enforce the disclosure requirements. It also permits the IRS to disclose to the OGE any federal tax return that is required to be disclosed by this bill, but has not been submitted to the OGE within a specified deadline.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and
