The bill defines E 15 as gasoline containing 15% ethanol. Specifically, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise labeling requirements for fuel pumps that dispense E 15 fuel, including by requiring the labels of such fuel pumps to include additional details. The labels must include warning information about vehicles, engines, and equipment (e.g., boats, lawn mowers, chain saws, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and pre-2001 model year vehicles) that are prohibited from using E 15. In addition, the EPA must implement a public education campaign concerning the risks associated with the improper use of E 15 fuel in such vehicles, engines, and equipment.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-06","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11164,"person_hash":"qvy181au","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Austin Scott","first_name":"Austin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-8","ftm_eid":6805076,"votesmart_id":11812,"opensecrets_id":"N00032457","knowwho_pid":193858,"ballotpedia":"Austin_Scott","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14893,"person_hash":"15yl52n3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lois Frankel","first_name":"Lois","middle_name":"","last_name":"Frankel","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-22","ftm_eid":12998905,"votesmart_id":8102,"opensecrets_id":"N00002893","knowwho_pid":193594,"ballotpedia":"Lois_Frankel","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9389,"person_hash":"8gue0k26","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Wittman","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Wittman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-1","ftm_eid":6666723,"votesmart_id":58133,"opensecrets_id":"N00029459","knowwho_pid":241260,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Wittman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18298,"person_hash":"reoz38xt","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Charlie Crist","first_name":"Charlie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crist","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-13","ftm_eid":1736080,"votesmart_id":24311,"opensecrets_id":"N00002942","knowwho_pid":218595,"ballotpedia":"Charlie_Crist","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9197,"person_hash":"cw1v2ewn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Posey","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-8","ftm_eid":12998616,"votesmart_id":24280,"opensecrets_id":"N00029662","knowwho_pid":193543,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Posey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9232,"person_hash":"aiyghgq9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Sensenbrenner","first_name":"F.
