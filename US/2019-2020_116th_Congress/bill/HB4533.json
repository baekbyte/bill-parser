Specifically, the bill provides funds for and requires the Indian Health Service (IHS) to award grants to Indian health facilities for the prevention and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders. The IHS must establish a technical assistance center for grantees. The bill defines Indian for purposes of health insurance reform, exchanges, and subsidies to include individuals of Indian descent who are members of an Indian community served by the IHS and individuals considered by the Department of Health and Human Services to be Indian for purposes of eligibility for Indian health care services. Individuals included in the definition are eligible for special monthly enrollment periods on health insurance exchanges and elimination of cost sharing under individual health coverage for those whose income is not more than 300% of the poverty line. Under current law, only members of Indian tribes are eligible for these benefits. The bill also exempts Indians, as defined by the bill, from the tax penalty for not maintaining minimum essential health coverage.","pending_committee_id":4148,"committee":{"committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-26","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-09-27","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2019-10-07","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-27","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8957,"person_hash":"0lt6ddgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Frank Pallone","first_name":"Frank","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pallone","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-6","ftm_eid":17658803,"votesmart_id":26951,"opensecrets_id":"N00000781","knowwho_pid":158957,"ballotpedia":"Frank_Pallone","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15236,"person_hash":"krtaqpow","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Ruiz","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ruiz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-36","ftm_eid":17657757,"votesmart_id":136407,"opensecrets_id":"N00033510","knowwho_pid":291125,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Ruiz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3126","sast_bill_id":1292593}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13780,"subject_name":"Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"},{"subject_id":13621,"subject_name":"Comprehensive health care"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2055825,"date":"2019-10-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4533\/id\/2055825","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4533\/BILLS-116hr4533ih.pdf","text_size":357236,"text_hash":"e999b3b1a6edd4ffcf7556f31706b1be"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
