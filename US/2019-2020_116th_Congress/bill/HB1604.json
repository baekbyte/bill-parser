Specifically, the bill revokes the security clearance of an individual who is in a position in the Executive Office of the President and (1) who is under investigation by a federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government, or (2) who knowingly fails to disclose any relationship or contact with a foreign national on their security clearance form. It also prohibits the issuance or renewal of security clearance under these circumstances. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must submit a report to Congress on any instance since January 20, 2017, in which an individual who is in a position in the Executive Office of the
