Specifically, the bill prohibits (1) an individual from reporting such negative credit information to a consumer reporting agency and (2) the inclusion of such negative credit information on a credit report. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must maintain a database of affected federal employees and contractors and make the database accessible to consumer reporting agencies. Subsequently, consumer reporting agencies must delete all negative credit information from the relevant time period regarding affected federal employees and contractors. Consumer reporting agencies must also make additional free credit reports available to an affected individual upon request.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18413,"person_hash":"i8432eqr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Kennedy","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kennedy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-LA","ftm_eid":13010864,"votesmart_id":35496,"opensecrets_id":"N00026823","knowwho_pid":240389,"ballotpedia":"John_Neely_Kennedy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1951620,"date":"2019-03-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB535\/id\/1951620","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s535\/BILLS-116s535is.pdf","text_size":288014,"text_hash":"4a72fed001021144756a50bbb57e3902"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
