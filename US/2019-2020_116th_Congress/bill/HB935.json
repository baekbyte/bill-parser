The Department of the Treasury must transfer additional funds to the 1974 United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Pension Plan to pay pension benefits required under that plan if the annual limit on transfers under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 exceeds the amount required to be transferred for existing obligations of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. The bill also increases the annual limit on transfers from $490 million to $750 million. The bill also allows in-service distributions under a pension plan or governmental section 457(b) plan at age 59-1\/2 (currently age 62).","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-31","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural
