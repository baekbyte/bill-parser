It eliminates the current $10,000 cap on the deduction in 2020 and 2021 except for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $100 million. The bill increases the deduction for the expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers from $250 to $1.000. It also allows a deduction from gross income (above-the-line deduction) for expenses of first responders, up to $1,000, for tuition or fees for professional development courses related to service as a first responder or for uniforms used by first responders. The bill defines \"first responder\" as any individual employed as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, paramedic, or emergency medical technician for at least 1,000 hours during the taxable year. The bill increases the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% beginning in 2020, and reduces the dollar amount at which the increased tax rate begins.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-10","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2020-01-03","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 24 - 17.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-13","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Ways and Means.
