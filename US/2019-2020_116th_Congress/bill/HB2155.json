In the case of the disclosure of personally identifiable information for medical research, a genetic testing service must follow the federal rules for obtaining informed consent in the context of research involving human subjects.Further, genetic testing services must provide consumers with the option to consent to disclose a consumer's genetic information but not to disclose other personally identifiable information. A genetic testing service may not condition services on obtaining consent to disclose such information. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) must promulgate regulations establishing how genetic testing services are required to secure such personally identifiable information against unauthorized access. The bill grants the FTC and state attorneys general powers to enforce compliance with the requirements of this bill.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-04-10","committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9119,"person_hash":"te6etur1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bobby Rush","first_name":"Bobby","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Rush","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-1","ftm_eid":17657928,"votesmart_id":26831,"opensecrets_id":"N00004887","knowwho_pid":158828,"ballotpedia":"Bobby_Rush","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9068,"person_hash":"ludkkyov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sheila Jackson-Lee","first_name":"Sheila","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jackson-Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-18","ftm_eid":6716263,"votesmart_id":21692,"opensecrets_id":"N00005818","knowwho_pid":159088,"ballotpedia":"Sheila_Jackson_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9140,"person_hash":"tzyevmen","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dina Titus","first_name":"Dina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Titus","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NV-1","ftm_eid":12996791,"votesmart_id":2629,"opensecrets_id":"N00030191","knowwho_pid":197530,"ballotpedia":"Dina_Titus","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20045,"person_hash":"a2aso5jv","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ed Case","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Case","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-1","ftm_eid":10085353,"votesmart_id":3422,"opensecrets_id":"N00025882","knowwho_pid":193944,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Case","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9019,"person_hash":"lcudj1xk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andre Carson","first_name":"Andre","middle_name":"","last_name":"Carson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-7","ftm_eid":17658782,"votesmart_id":84917,"opensecrets_id":"N00029513","knowwho_pid":263260,"ballotpedia":"Andr%C3%A9_Carson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18332,"person_hash":"fizx4b9o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darren Soto","first_name":"Darren","middle_name":"","last_name":"Soto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-9","ftm_eid":198924,"votesmart_id":67618,"opensecrets_id":"N00037422","knowwho_pid":255376,"ballotpedia":"Darren_Soto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9056,"person_hash":"ejicyent","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alcee Hastings","first_name":"Alcee","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Hastings","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-20","ftm_eid":17657879,"votesmart_id":26798,"opensecrets_id":"N00002884","knowwho_pid":158806,"ballotpedia":"Alcee_Hastings","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":8,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
