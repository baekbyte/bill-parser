Specifically, the bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to establish rural obstetric networks for improving outcomes in birth and maternal morbidity through collaboration, training, and program evaluation. HRSA also must award demonstration program grants to (1) train physicians, medical residents, and other practitioners to provide maternal and obstetric services in rural communities; and (2) support academic programs that develop or provide training to improve maternal care in rural areas. Further, the bill adds maternal health services as part of the telehealth network and telehealth resource centers grant programs. The bill also makes a series of changes to the research and reporting requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Government Accountability Office with respect to data on maternal health outcomes. Additionally, the bill establishes grants to (1) develop best practices to reduce preventable maternal mortality; (2) train health care professionals about reducing and preventing discrimination when providing maternal health services; (3) support the collaboration of professionals across health settings with respect to maternal health; (4) establish evidence-informed, integrated health care services for pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. HRSA also must contract with an independent research organization to study and make recommendations to accredited school training programs about discrimination and implicit and explicit biases.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-11-12","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2020-09-22","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Hearings Held Prior to Introduction and Referral.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-13","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-13","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-17","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
