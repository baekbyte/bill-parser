Specifically, the bill requires the International Trade Administration (ITA) to assess the location of and services provided by U.S. Export Assistance Centers in relation to the location of SMEs that export U.S. products and services. The ITA shall then issue a report identifying (1) centers that serve a comparatively high number of SMEs, and (2) locations where a center should be established. Further, the ITA shall implement the changes recommended in such report and may establish up to 30 new centers based on the report. In addition, the ITA shall take necessary steps, through actions by the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, to increase exports by SMEs.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-16","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-16","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15214,"person_hash":"7yh6sk6a","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cheri Bustos","first_name":"Cheri","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bustos","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-17","ftm_eid":15306815,"votesmart_id":134964,"opensecrets_id":"N00033390","knowwho_pid":378493,"ballotpedia":"Cheri_Bustos","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18330,"person_hash":"27fxeixn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Rutherford","first_name":"John","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Rutherford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-4","ftm_eid":37039917,"votesmart_id":172542,"opensecrets_id":"N00039777","knowwho_pid":581000,"ballotpedia":"John_Rutherford_(Florida)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13731,"subject_name":"Foreign trade and international finance"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2081815,"date":"2019-12-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5437\/id\/2081815","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5437\/BILLS-116hr5437ih.pdf","text_size":327212,"text_hash":"97fea20feb22d641c822811270e5544d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
