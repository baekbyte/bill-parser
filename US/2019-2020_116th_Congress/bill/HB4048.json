When such a device has been activated, the video recording must be provided to the remote user via smart phone or similar device at the time the recording is being made.Except for specified purposes, the use, or transfer to a third party, of such recordings from smart speakers or video doorbells is prohibited unless the user (1) is given clear notice, (2) provides express consent for the specific use or transfer, and (3) has the ability to delete such recordings at any time.
