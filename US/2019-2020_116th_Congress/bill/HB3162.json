Specifically, the bill requires each provider to report certain information regarding the geographic availability of broadband service it provides. The FCC must contract with an entity to provide data submission assistance to a provider that is unable to comply with this reporting requirement. Among other responsibilities, such entity shall provide support for the required challenge process and establish an ongoing data validation and verification process. The FCC is also required to establish a framework for a process whereby information challenging the accuracy of the National Broadband Map may be submitted. Subject to the challenge process and feedback received therefrom, specified federal agencies shall use the National Broadband Map to determine the extent of broadband availability and the areas of the United States that remain unserved.","pending_committee_id":2358,"committee":{"committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-06","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-06-07","committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9193,"person_hash":"4p9iymg5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cathy McMorris Rodgers","first_name":"Cathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McMorris Rodgers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-5","ftm_eid":2941046,"votesmart_id":3217,"opensecrets_id":"N00026314","knowwho_pid":199779,"ballotpedia":"Cathy_McMorris_Rodgers","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18325,"person_hash":"hk0dd3t3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom O'Halleran","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"O'Halleran","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-1","ftm_eid":12997748,"votesmart_id":28499,"opensecrets_id":"N00037515","knowwho_pid":205735,"ballotpedia":"Tom_O%27Halleran","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11063,"person_hash":"zxbr0ie0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David McKinley","first_name":"David","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"McKinley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WV-1","ftm_eid":7565199,"votesmart_id":117396,"opensecrets_id":"N00031681","knowwho_pid":284510,"ballotpedia":"David_McKinley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15227,"person_hash":"yx3y1j2l","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ann Kuster","first_name":"Ann","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Kuster","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NH-2","ftm_eid":9794994,"votesmart_id":122256,"opensecrets_id":"N00030875","knowwho_pid":284835,"ballotpedia":"Annie_Kuster","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9389,"person_hash":"8gue0k26","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Wittman","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Wittman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-1","ftm_eid":6666723,"votesmart_id":58133,"opensecrets_id":"N00029459","knowwho_pid":241260,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Wittman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
