The bill authorizes a third party to submit evidence to the PTO to oppose an application for a federal trademark registration. The bill establishes a procedure for any party to petition the PTO to expunge a registration for a trademark that has not been used in commerce. The bill also establishes a procedure for any party to petition the PTO to reexamine any trademark registration on such nonuse grounds. The PTO may also initiate such an expungement or reexamination proceeding. If a plaintiff has prevailed in court in asserting certain trademark rights, that plaintiff shall be entitled to a presumption that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm for purposes of determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to a permanent injunction. If a trademark plaintiff is seeking a preliminary injunction, that plaintiff is entitled to this presumption upon a court finding that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of the case. Under current law, a plaintiff must establish irreparable harm to secure an injunction. The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on PTO efforts to address false and inaccurate claims in trademark registrations and applications.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-11","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9624,"person_hash":"rsz1qtnd","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Coons","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Coons","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-DE","ftm_eid":5584171,"votesmart_id":122834,"opensecrets_id":"N00031820","knowwho_pid":286419,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Coons","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6196","sast_bill_id":1359198}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13614,"subject_name":"Intellectual property"},{"subject_id":13418,"subject_name":"Judicial review and appeals"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177126,"date":"2020-04-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3449\/id\/2177126","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3449\/BILLS-116s3449is.pdf","text_size":352695,"text_hash":"5a3606b9d7e35d53abdfd8c714223e0b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
