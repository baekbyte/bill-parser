Among other things, the FRA must perform physical testing of rail tank cars, including ensuring such rail tank cars are able to withstand the effects of an accident or impact and prevent or mitigate the release of LNG; analyze multiple release scenarios, including derailments, front-end collisions, and rear-end collisions; and examine the effects of exposure to climate conditions across rail networks, including temperature, humidity, and other factors that may influence performance of the inner or outer walls of rail tank cars. The Government Accountability Office must conduct an independent evaluation to ensure all review requirements under this bill have been satisfactorily met.","pending_committee_id":2527,"committee":{"committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-12","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-09-13","committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9034,"person_hash":"klgqsf3d","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter DeFazio","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"DeFazio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-4","ftm_eid":17658713,"votesmart_id":27037,"opensecrets_id":"N00007781","knowwho_pid":159029,"ballotpedia":"Peter_DeFazio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20082,"person_hash":"tx2fp0ph","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Malinowski","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Malinowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-7","ftm_eid":44044869,"votesmart_id":179645,"opensecrets_id":"N00041843","knowwho_pid":495180,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Malinowski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9360,"person_hash":"18i3uo82","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Garamendi","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garamendi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-3","ftm_eid":12997062,"votesmart_id":29664,"opensecrets_id":"N00030856","knowwho_pid":240331,"ballotpedia":"John_Garamendi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7095","sast_bill_id":1368529},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2","sast_bill_id":1369459},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR1028","sast_bill_id":1372076}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13651,"subject_name":"Accidents"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13426,"subject_name":"Pollution liability"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13646,"subject_name":"Urban and suburban affairs and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053294,"date":"2019-09-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4306\/id\/2053294","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4306\/BILLS-116hr4306ih.pdf","text_size":357827,"text_hash":"c9328e66ec27dd4e94886a0b93f842b6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
