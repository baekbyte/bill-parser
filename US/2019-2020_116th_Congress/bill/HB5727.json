Specifically, Medicare-participating hospitals that divert ambulances from their emergency departments must report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on (1) the length of the diversion, (2) the reason for the diversion, and (3) the number of ambulance calls turned away while the diversion was in effect. Hospitals that comply with the reporting requirements receive increased Medicare payments until 2024. Beginning in 2025, hospitals that fail to report receive reduced Medicare payments. In addition, the National Academy of Medicine must conduct a study and provide recommendations to mitigate the occurrence of ambulance diversions and improve the health and safety of patients affected by ambulance diversions.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-30","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9119,"person_hash":"te6etur1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bobby Rush","first_name":"Bobby","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Rush","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-1","ftm_eid":17657928,"votesmart_id":26831,"opensecrets_id":"N00004887","knowwho_pid":158828,"ballotpedia":"Bobby_Rush","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9137,"person_hash":"bhtcm97e","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bennie Thompson","first_name":"Bennie","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MS-2","ftm_eid":8348996,"votesmart_id":26929,"opensecrets_id":"N00003288","knowwho_pid":158929,"ballotpedia":"Bennie_Thompson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16485,"person_hash":"0vtl1zss","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bonnie Coleman","first_name":"Bonnie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-12","ftm_eid":6389632,"votesmart_id":24799,"opensecrets_id":"N00036158","knowwho_pid":362925,"ballotpedia":"Bonnie_Watson_Coleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18289,"person_hash":"k4hlca04","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nanette Barragan","first_name":"Nanette","middle_name":"Diaz","last_name":"Barragan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-44","ftm_eid":39707282,"votesmart_id":166270,"opensecrets_id":"N00037019","knowwho_pid":536062,"ballotpedia":"Nanette_Barrag%C3%A1n","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18292,"person_hash":"c8kj8aoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lisa Rochester","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"Blunt","last_name":"Rochester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DE","ftm_eid":38420440,"votesmart_id":173249,"opensecrets_id":"N00038414","knowwho_pid":558891,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Blunt_Rochester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2118226,"date":"2020-02-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5727\/id\/2118226","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5727\/BILLS-116hr5727ih.pdf","text_size":327108,"text_hash":"4c4e401589d79c17590f6cb40e66f34b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
