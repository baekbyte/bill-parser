Specifically, the FDA must inspect at least 20% of all imported seafood each year and must also inspect the first 15 shipments imported into the United States by a new exporter. The bill also imposes various requirements and penalties for failed inspections, including by (1) requiring the destruction of a shipment that would have caused significant health risks, and (2) barring imports from a country with a pattern of failed inspections. The bill also imposes civil penalties for knowingly making a false statement with respect to such inspections or misbranding imported seafood.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-01","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-01","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18310,"person_hash":"mpcv1p4d","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Clay Higgins","first_name":"Clay","middle_name":"","last_name":"Higgins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-3","ftm_eid":41316479,"votesmart_id":174484,"opensecrets_id":"N00039953","knowwho_pid":588003,"ballotpedia":"Clay_Higgins","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13521,"subject_name":"Food supply, safety, and labeling"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13878,"subject_name":"Seafood"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2209635,"date":"2020-09-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8146\/id\/2209635","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8146\/BILLS-116hr8146ih.pdf","text_size":303755,"text_hash":"0a0845249f43832db459c0ed8e0f43a6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
