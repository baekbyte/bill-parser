Specifically, the CDC, in coordination with certain departments and agencies, must award grants for contact tracing to, among others, public health departments and health care providers. In awarding these grants, the CDC shall prioritize entities with a demonstrated commitment to employing individuals who represent the demographic groups in the community served by the entity. The CDC must also work with states to update certain COVID-19 testing plans to address testing for populations experiencing COVID-19 health disparities. Additionally, the CDC must award grants to public health departments, tribal organizations, and others for public awareness campaigns on COVID-19 health disparities and, upon the availability of a vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine safety. For these grants, the CDC must give priority to entities serving populations that experience COVID-19 health disparities and low rates of vaccinations, respectively. The CDC must undertake a separate COVID-19 public awareness campaign, as well. In addition, the OMH must develop, within 30 days, an action plan on COVID-19 health disparities that addresses, among other issues, barriers to COVID-19 data collection. The OMH must coordinate with the CDC and others on this plan and update it at least every 30 days during the COVID-19 emergency.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-11","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15217,"person_hash":"ti9w2cwq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tony Cardenas","first_name":"Tony","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cardenas","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-29","ftm_eid":17657742,"votesmart_id":9754,"opensecrets_id":"N00033373","knowwho_pid":193068,"ballotpedia":"Tony_C%C3%A1rdenas","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16485,"person_hash":"0vtl1zss","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bonnie Coleman","first_name":"Bonnie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-12","ftm_eid":6389632,"votesmart_id":24799,"opensecrets_id":"N00036158","knowwho_pid":362925,"ballotpedia":"Bonnie_Watson_Coleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4262","sast_bill_id":1374065}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13763,"subject_name":"Community life and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":22689,"subject_name":"Foreign language and bilingual programs"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":20700,"subject_name":"Minority employment"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2208495,"date":"2020-09-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8203\/id\/2208495","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8203\/BILLS-116hr8203ih.pdf","text_size":328210,"text_hash":"5398ca8a480d28aabccfae9f2bf055fd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
