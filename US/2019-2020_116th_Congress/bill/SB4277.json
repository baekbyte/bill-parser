The bill requires the EPA to perform outreach activities to provide information to states about (1) the exposure of children to environmental hazards in school facilities; (2) regulations and guidelines applicable to environmental hazards in school facilities; and (3) other materials to assist in addressing environmental problems, contaminants, hazardous substances, and pollutant emissions. Additionally, the EPA must annually convene school stakeholders (e.g., parents) to discuss topics related to the environmental health of children at school and the prevention, identification, and remediation of contaminants in school buildings and grounds. The bill adds polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to the list of emitted substances that the EPA must account for when issuing voluntary guidelines to states for the purpose of their environmental health programs. Such guidelines must also (1) provide technical assistance for the removal, remediation, and disposal of PCBs and other hazardous substances; and (2) collect an inventory of schools affected by PCBs and other hazardous substances. To the maximum extent possible, the EPA must make publicly available (1) information on the exposure of children to environmental hazards in school facilities, and (2) an inventory of schools in which PCBs have been found in light ballasts or other media.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-22","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":321502,"subject_name":"Lighting, heating, cooling"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2204683,"date":"2020-08-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4277\/id\/2204683","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4277\/BILLS-116s4277is.pdf","text_size":308899,"text_hash":"53ad0f5cdf9e617f48523a8d4a6fae2e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
