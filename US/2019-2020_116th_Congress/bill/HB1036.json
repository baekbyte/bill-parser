Among other things, it exempts from mortgage originator requirements those lenders providing financing to five (currently three) or fewer properties in a year, including corporations and partnerships that would otherwise be regulated as mortgage originators. The bill also removes the requirement that such lenders, in order to be exempt from these requirements, must verify the buyer's ability to repay the loan.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20097,"person_hash":"grn495qr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Denver Riggleman","first_name":"Denver","middle_name":"","last_name":"Riggleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-5","ftm_eid":37981574,"votesmart_id":181445,"opensecrets_id":"N00043541","knowwho_pid":613877,"ballotpedia":"Denver_Riggleman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1920441,"date":"2019-02-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1036\/id\/1920441","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1036\/BILLS-116hr1036ih.pdf","text_size":278422,"text_hash":"8c3bbfc908cc9a08f1e5aeff2edaaa20"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
