The bill limits participation in VA educational assistance programs if an educational institution (1) does not perform specified actions, such as providing cost information to individuals prior to enrollment; (2) implements fraudulent recruiting techniques or pays inducements to secure enrollments; or (3) is the subject of a negative action by its accrediting agency. The state approving agency or the VA shall impose limitations by publishing a warning or temporarily prohibiting the pursuit of a course of education at an institution. The bill provides for waivers of certain requirements for a one-year period, but waivers may not be provided for more than two consecutive academic years. The bill also prohibits the VA from approving the enrollment of an eligible veteran or eligible person in any course offered by an institution engaged in substantial misrepresentation (e.g., misrepresenting the size, location, facilities, or equipment of the institution). Finally, the bill modifies the criteria that non-accredited courses must meet to be eligible for educational assistance. The bill adds requirements for (1) the educational institution offering the course to refrain from substantial misrepresentation; and (2) the state approving agency to review advertising, sales, or enrollment materials used by the institution.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-08","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-10-14","committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"},{"date":"2019-11-13","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-16","action":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-16","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-16","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
