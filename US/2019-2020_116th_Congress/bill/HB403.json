The Department of the Interior shall (1) use the 2006 Clear Creek Management Area Travel Management Plan, as modified by this bill or by Interior, to incorporate natural resource protection information unavailable in 2006 as the basis for an interim management plan to govern off-highway vehicle recreation in the area; and (2) create a comprehensive management plan for the area, which shall include a hazards education program and a user fee program for motorized vehicle use. Landowners must be given adequate access to inholdings (i.e., privately-owned land inside the boundary of a national park) within the area. The use of motorized vehicles on public land in the area shall be permitted only on roads, trails, and areas designated by the management plan. Livestock grazing shall be allowed to continue in certain parts of the area. The bill (1) designates approximately 21,000 acres of identified federal lands in Fresno and San Benito Counties, California, as the Joaquin Rocks Wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System; and (2) releases the San Benito Mountain wilderness study area from wilderness review requirements.","pending_committee_id":3991,"committee":{"committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-09","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18326,"person_hash":"j8jlv1qm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jimmy Panetta","first_name":"Jimmy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Panetta","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-20","ftm_eid":35018515,"votesmart_id":169078,"opensecrets_id":"N00038601","knowwho_pid":561057,"ballotpedia":"Jimmy_Panetta","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13391,"subject_name":"California"},{"subject_id":13420,"subject_name":"Lakes and rivers"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13257,"subject_name":"Parks, recreation areas, trails"},{"subject_id":13301,"subject_name":"Wilderness and natural areas, wildlife refuges, wild rivers, habitats"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1874337,"date":"2019-01-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB403\/id\/1874337","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr403\/BILLS-116hr403ih.pdf","text_size":139642,"text_hash":"caaa5bc9c2875fa77f5b4824055eafd8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
