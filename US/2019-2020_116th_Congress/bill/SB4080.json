Such strategy shall include (1) an assessment of the global threat from white identity terrorism abroad, (2) detailed plans for using public diplomacy to degrade and delegitimize white identity terrorist ideologues and ideology globally, and (3) an outline of how the State Department plans to use designation as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist or foreign terrorist organization to support the strategy. Annual country reports on terrorism must include all credible information about white identity terrorism, and the President must determine whether the foreign persons, organizations, and networks identified in such reports satisfy the criteria to be designated as (1) foreign terrorist organizations, or (2) Specially Designated Global Terrorist Organizations.
