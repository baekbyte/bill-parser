An employee is considered eligible if the employee has not received specified disciplinary action and is otherwise determined eligible by the agency. In the event the public health emergency is renewed, the bill's requirements continue to apply if the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), determines the requirements would reduce the spread of COVID-19. If the requirements no longer apply, agencies may still allow high-risk employees or employees at certain work sites to telework full-time during the renewal period. Additionally, OPM must, in coordination with HHS, develop an expansive telework policy for use in future outbreaks of infectious diseases.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-22","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9141,"person_hash":"52gl0w7n","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chris Van Hollen","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Hollen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":5552236,"votesmart_id":6098,"opensecrets_id":"N00013820","knowwho_pid":195215,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Van_Hollen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11061,"person_hash":"r3ltpj5e","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Lankford","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lankford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-5","ftm_eid":17657561,"votesmart_id":124938,"opensecrets_id":"N00031129","knowwho_pid":284972,"ballotpedia":"James_Lankford","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13786,"subject_name":"Commuting"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177820,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3561\/id\/2177820","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3561\/BILLS-116s3561is.pdf","text_size":318218,"text_hash":"1bc3e11e8d89def9d6fcadfbcaad9250"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
