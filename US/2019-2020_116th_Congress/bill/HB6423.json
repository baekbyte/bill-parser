Among other things, debt collectors may not during this period charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment, commence or continue litigation to collect a debt, enforce a security interest through a repossession or foreclosure, report past due debt to a credit reporting agency, seize assets, or terminate utility service. The bill also prohibits during this period a confession of judgment or similar agreement as a condition to a loan or extension of credit.
