Under current law, such equity investments are treated like grants for federal budgetary scoring, which requires the government to provide through appropriations the full amount that may be invested (i.e., dollar-for-dollar funding). The bill instead deems such equity investments a federal credit program. As a result, such investments are scored based on an estimated repayment rate, and appropriation of the full investment amount is not required.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-09","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14925,"person_hash":"r2dpo5e5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Yoho","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yoho","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-3","ftm_eid":17657842,"votesmart_id":137622,"opensecrets_id":"N00033220","knowwho_pid":378855,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Yoho","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9201,"person_hash":"76ewpko5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adam Smith","first_name":"Adam","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-9","ftm_eid":17658734,"votesmart_id":845,"opensecrets_id":"N00007833","knowwho_pid":159125,"ballotpedia":"Adam_Smith_(Washington)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9192,"person_hash":"77p1skl0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael McCaul","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McCaul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-10","ftm_eid":15456789,"votesmart_id":49210,"opensecrets_id":"N00026460","knowwho_pid":226551,"ballotpedia":"Michael_McCaul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20097,"person_hash":"grn495qr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Denver Riggleman","first_name":"Denver","middle_name":"","last_name":"Riggleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-5","ftm_eid":37981574,"votesmart_id":181445,"opensecrets_id":"N00043541","knowwho_pid":613877,"ballotpedia":"Denver_Riggleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13197,"subject_name":"Government corporations and government-sponsored enterprises"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2203687,"date":"2020-08-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7570\/id\/2203687","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7570\/BILLS-116hr7570ih.pdf","text_size":302899,"text_hash":"6a84cd00695251e8798a349816e12103"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
