Specifically, the bill concerns veterans to whom the VA is required to provide domiciliary, nursing home, adult day health, or hospital care. Licensed or certified residential care facilities include, but are not limited to, assisted living facilities, basic care facilities, community residences, enriched housing programs, homes for the aged, personal care homes, and shared housing establishments. Under the bill, the VA may enter into a contract or agreement with a licensed or certified residential care facility if the cost of the facility is less than the cost of providing care to such veterans through any other available option.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
