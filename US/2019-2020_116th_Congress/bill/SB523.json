Specifically, HHS must develop a strategic action plan and a climate and health program to ensure the public health and health care systems in the United States and other nations are prepared for, and can respond to, the impacts of climate change on health. The bill directs HHS to revise the plan periodically to reflect new scientific developments and information. HHS must establish a permanent science advisory board to provide (1) scientific and technical recommendations on the impacts of climate change on public health, and (2) advice for purposes of issuing the plan and conducting the program.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And
