(Under the program, manufacturers work with the FDA to expedite the review and approval of certain medical devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human diseases or conditions.) The bill allows designated medical breakthrough devices to be temporarily covered under Medicare during a three-year transitional period. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must assign payment codes for such devices within three months of FDA approval. The CMS must also establish a process to allow for continued coverage after the transitional period has expired, taking into account any additional evidence or data the CMS deems necessary. The CMS must also provide for temporary and, where appropriate, permanent Medicare coverage of breakthrough devices for which there is no existing benefit category (i.e., classification).","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-08","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-08","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5333","sast_bill_id":1287147}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199722,"date":"2020-07-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3914\/id\/2199722","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3914\/BILLS-116s3914is.pdf","text_size":341391,"text_hash":"c3a97eae4e1223cc146bb8fe6816af40"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
