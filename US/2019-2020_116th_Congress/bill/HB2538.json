Once the Office of School Security determines that an issue exists, parents are given the opportunity to enroll in CSAs for tuition and fees at qualified schools, tutoring services, textbooks, transportation costs, therapy costs to cope with safety incidents, and college courses. The bill sets forth procedures for scholarship granting organizations to accept donations for CSAs and pay out scholarships for students. CSA donors must be taxpayers, individuals, or corporations who file District income tax returns, cannot be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer return, has donated to a scholarship granting organization, and has been certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the District to make the donation. Finally, this bill establishes a District program to provide tax credits against income tax imposed by the District on (1) certified donors to CSAs, and (2) parents for eligible expenses above the amount provided by the CSA.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-07","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18288,"person_hash":"prykhtgd","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Banks","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Banks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-3","ftm_eid":2949733,"votesmart_id":116801,"opensecrets_id":"N00037185","knowwho_pid":291462,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Banks_(Indiana)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15228,"person_hash":"pbm46q1a","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doug LaMalfa","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"","last_name":"LaMalfa","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-1","ftm_eid":1560957,"votesmart_id":29713,"opensecrets_id":"N00033987","knowwho_pid":211738,"ballotpedia":"Doug_LaMalfa","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14925,"person_hash":"r2dpo5e5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Yoho","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yoho","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-3","ftm_eid":17657842,"votesmart_id":137622,"opensecrets_id":"N00033220","knowwho_pid":378855,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Yoho","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9197,"person_hash":"cw1v2ewn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Posey","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-8","ftm_eid":12998616,"votesmart_id":24280,"opensecrets_id":"N00029662","knowwho_pid":193543,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Posey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13443,"subject_name":"Crimes against children"},{"subject_id":13167,"subject_name":"District of Columbia"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13656,"subject_name":"Juvenile crime and gang violence"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"},{"subject_id":13343,"subject_name":"Violent crime"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2033432,"date":"2019-06-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2538\/id\/2033432","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2538\/BILLS-116hr2538ih.pdf","text_size":236482,"text_hash":"5365051313aa75b7c8bc3794fe93b412"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
