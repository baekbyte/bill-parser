Specifically, the DOE must develop and implement a strategic plan that advances energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices to minimize freshwater withdrawal and consumption, seismic impacts, and deleterious impacts on water bodies, groundwater, and waterways; increase water use efficiency; and utilize nontraditional water sources. Further, the strategic plan must (1) consider the effects climate variability may have on water supplies and quality for energy generation and fuel production, and (2) improve the understanding of the energy required to provide reliable water supplies as well as the water required to provide reliable energy supplies. The plan must be updated every five years. In addition, DOE must establish an Energy-Water Committee to promote and enable improved energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-04","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9445,"person_hash":"f2k79x2t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Crapo","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crapo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":19890076,"votesmart_id":26830,"opensecrets_id":"N00006267","knowwho_pid":165218,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Crapo","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB34","sast_bill_id":1137501}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13390,"subject_name":"Water resources development"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13155,"subject_name":"Department of Energy"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13393,"subject_name":"Water storage"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2073526,"date":"2019-12-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2978\/id\/2073526","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2978\/BILLS-116s2978is.pdf","text_size":335311,"text_hash":"89a90e8d019f8295785da159399b7281"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
