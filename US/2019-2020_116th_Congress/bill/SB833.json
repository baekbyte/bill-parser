The bill changes the voting procedure for suspending plan benefits to provide that a suspension shall go into effect unless a majority of plan participants and beneficiaries who cast a vote (currently, a majority of all plan participants and beneficiaries) reject the suspension. The bill also eliminates the authority of the Department of the Treasury, in the case of systemically important plans, to override a vote of plan participants to reject a suspension. A plan is systemically important if projected financial assistance to the plan will exceed $1 billion if suspensions are not implemented.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-14","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11966,"person_hash":"d5cx9z5s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rob Portman","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Portman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3094681,"votesmart_id":27008,"opensecrets_id":"N00003682","knowwho_pid":159002,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Portman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15315,"person_hash":"gjw81slg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Deb Fischer","first_name":"Deb","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fischer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NE","ftm_eid":13012823,"votesmart_id":41963,"opensecrets_id":"N00033443","knowwho_pid":228296,"ballotpedia":"Deb_Fischer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9486,"person_hash":"1riyfn00","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Burr","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burr","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":6860429,"votesmart_id":21787,"opensecrets_id":"N00002221","knowwho_pid":158938,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Burr","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19529,"person_hash":"ygy5eihl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Doug Jones","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Jones","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AL","ftm_eid":15183709,"votesmart_id":176464,"opensecrets_id":"N00024817","knowwho_pid":625255,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Jones_(Alabama)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9305,"person_hash":"t3dzh81l","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jerry Moran","first_name":"Jerry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moran","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-1","ftm_eid":19889609,"votesmart_id":542,"opensecrets_id":"N00005282","knowwho_pid":158858,"ballotpedia":"Jerry_Moran","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1981278,"date":"2019-04-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB833\/id\/1981278","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s833\/BILLS-116s833is.pdf","text_size":277359,"text_hash":"c9a648f011a8b8e7f584b874ac98cbdb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
