Specifically, a person or the Department of Housing and Urban Development may report information related to a consumer's performance in making payments either under a lease agreement for a dwelling or pursuant to a contract for a utility or telecommunications service. However, information about a consumer's usage of any utility or telecommunications service may be reported only to the extent that the information relates to payment by the consumer for such service or other terms of the provision of that service. Furthermore, an energy-utility firm may not report a consumer's outstanding balance as late if the firm and the consumer have entered into a payment plan and the consumer is meeting the obligations of that plan. Specified provisions that establish civil liability with respect to furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies shall not apply to any violation of the bill. The Government Accountability Office must report on the consumer impact of such reporting.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-06","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16463,"person_hash":"v6sesxl9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"French Hill","first_name":"French","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hill","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-2","ftm_eid":9620575,"votesmart_id":146290,"opensecrets_id":"N00035792","knowwho_pid":475052,"ballotpedia":"French_Hill","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18308,"person_hash":"1un0d11b","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Vicente Gonzalez","first_name":"Vicente","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gonzalez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-15","ftm_eid":17872003,"votesmart_id":166483,"opensecrets_id":"N00038809","knowwho_pid":561764,"ballotpedia":"Vicente_Gonzalez_Jr.","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16458,"person_hash":"3z9mh67s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Emmer","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Emmer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-6","ftm_eid":12996955,"votesmart_id":38894,"opensecrets_id":"N00035440","knowwho_pid":227769,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Emmer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1828","sast_bill_id":1268491}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":81071,"subject_name":"Debt collection"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2052059,"date":"2019-09-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4231\/id\/2052059","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4231\/BILLS-116hr4231ih.pdf","text_size":353006,"text_hash":"5b6763e4108b6fc54c80d7bb0b791033"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
