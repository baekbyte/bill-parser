In addition, a small business that performed as a first-tier subcontractor for an agency contract may request that the prime contractor submit to a contracting agency a record of past performance, and the agency's contracting officer must consider such record when evaluating an offer by the small business for a prime contract.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-18","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},{"date":"2020-01-09","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Reported by the Committee on Small Business.
