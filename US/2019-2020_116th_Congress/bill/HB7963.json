Specifically, a member may be expelled for cause pursuant to a policy adopted by a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of a credit union. Currently, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the credit union membership present at a special meeting. The expelled member may request reinstatement by the credit union board. Member conduct that may be cause for expulsion includes a loss to the credit union, a violation of the credit union membership agreement, a disruption to the operations of a credit union, fraud or attempted fraud, and other illegal or inappropriate behavior.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-07","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16458,"person_hash":"3z9mh67s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Emmer","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Emmer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-6","ftm_eid":12996955,"votesmart_id":38894,"opensecrets_id":"N00035440","knowwho_pid":227769,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Emmer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9309,"person_hash":"ro7scvdy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ed Perlmutter","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perlmutter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-7","ftm_eid":6276954,"votesmart_id":2653,"opensecrets_id":"N00027510","knowwho_pid":193129,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Perlmutter","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20104,"person_hash":"grfgr53p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elissa Slotkin","first_name":"Elissa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Slotkin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-8","ftm_eid":44044762,"votesmart_id":181080,"opensecrets_id":"N00041357","knowwho_pid":261745,"ballotpedia":"Elissa_Slotkin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3323","sast_bill_id":1348816}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206769,"date":"2020-09-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7963\/id\/2206769","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7963\/BILLS-116hr7963ih.pdf","text_size":299693,"text_hash":"256c6406e8d2702f607aa9379fafec43"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
