Specifically, if an alien became the national of a foreign country with a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States through a financial investment in that foreign country, the alien must have been domiciled in that foreign country for a continuous period of at least three years at any point before applying for an E visa. The bill also requires an alien seeking an E-2 visa (investor) to invest a substantial and economically impactful amount of capital in the United States, where currently the statute only requires an investment of a substantial amount.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-14","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9484,"person_hash":"1zy2f3m5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chuck Grassley","first_name":"Chuck","middle_name":"","last_name":"Grassley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6338995,"votesmart_id":53293,"opensecrets_id":"N00001758","knowwho_pid":165215,"ballotpedia":"Chuck_Grassley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2070491,"date":"2019-11-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2863\/id\/2070491","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2863\/BILLS-116s2863is.pdf","text_size":325291,"text_hash":"8a25c440aaaf516cd8645cae97bb6ad7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
