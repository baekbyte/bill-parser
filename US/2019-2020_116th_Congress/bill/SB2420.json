An adult alien shall not be admitted with a minor unless the adult (1) presents documents and witness testimony proving that the adult is a relative or guardian of the minor, or (2) submits to a DNA test that proves such a relationship. The Department of Homeland Security shall request a DNA test only if the required relationship cannot be established by specified evidence. An adult alien who does not consent to a requested DNA test shall be inadmissible. If the required relationship cannot be established and the immigration officer believes the alien is guilty of a felony offense, the officer may arrest the alien adult. The bill makes it a crime for an alien adult to knowingly use a minor to whom the adult is not a relative or guardian to enter the United States.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-01","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16519,"person_hash":"39r6j2zz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joni Ernst","first_name":"Joni","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ernst","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6151700,"votesmart_id":128583,"opensecrets_id":"N00035483","knowwho_pid":328986,"ballotpedia":"Joni_Ernst","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3864","sast_bill_id":1271780}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13443,"subject_name":"Crimes against children"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13470,"subject_name":"Family relationships"},{"subject_id":13506,"subject_name":"Genetics"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13311,"subject_name":"Immigrant health and welfare"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049245,"date":"2019-08-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2420\/id\/2049245","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2420\/BILLS-116s2420is.pdf","text_size":361593,"text_hash":"abaeccebbbe7e31bd0d83d5f82d3459e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
