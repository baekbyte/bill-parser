The bill specifies the factors that an IHE may use to limit these loans. These factors include the average starting salary for typical occupations pursued by graduates of the program, the enrollment status of the student (i.e., full- or part-time enrollment), the credential level of the program (e.g., degree or certificate), and the year of the program for which the student is seeking the loan. Upon request of a student whose loan has been prorated or limited, an IHE may increase the amount of the loan within otherwise applicable limits if the student demonstrates special circumstances or exceptional need.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-30","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16460,"person_hash":"ntqo7c9d","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Glenn Grothman","first_name":"Glenn","middle_name":"","last_name":"Grothman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-6","ftm_eid":2927726,"votesmart_id":3493,"opensecrets_id":"N00036409","knowwho_pid":199967,"ballotpedia":"Glenn_Grothman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205949,"date":"2020-08-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7872\/id\/2205949","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7872\/BILLS-116hr7872ih.pdf","text_size":301765,"text_hash":"19cf5fea0a9a0871f6539fab60c0ca3c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
