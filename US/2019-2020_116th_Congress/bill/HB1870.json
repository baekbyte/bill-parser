(Under current law, the coverage is unaffordable, and an employee may be eligible for premium assistance tax credits, if the employee's required contribution for an individual plan exceeds 9.5% of household income.) The bill specifies that, with respect to an employee's family members who are eligible to enroll in the plan, affordability must be determined using the cost of family coverage rather than individual coverage to expand the eligibility of families for premium assistance tax credits.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-26","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-26","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-26","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19700,"person_hash":"ku74u6oh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Susan Wild","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wild","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-7","ftm_eid":17853601,"votesmart_id":178895,"opensecrets_id":"N00041997","knowwho_pid":638609,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Wild","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9121,"person_hash":"7ammm44v","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Linda Sanchez","first_name":"Linda","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"Sanchez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-38","ftm_eid":17657762,"votesmart_id":29674,"opensecrets_id":"N00024870","knowwho_pid":211684,"ballotpedia":"Linda_S%C3%A1nchez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8979,"person_hash":"s3k15nh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben Lujan","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"Ray","last_name":"Lujan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-3","ftm_eid":9025644,"votesmart_id":102842,"opensecrets_id":"N00029562","knowwho_pid":266495,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Lujan,_Sr.","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9051,"person_hash":"x4hkzhov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Grijalva","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Grijalva","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-3","ftm_eid":17657668,"votesmart_id":28253,"opensecrets_id":"N00025284","knowwho_pid":211719,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Grijalva","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1884","sast_bill_id":1245145},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1425","sast_bill_id":1227365},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4521","sast_bill_id":1376037}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13672,"subject_name":"Tax treatment of families"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1987781,"date":"2019-04-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1870\/id\/1987781","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1870\/BILLS-116hr1870ih.pdf","text_size":154714,"text_hash":"7d8e0d5000bf0ecbd19a48c5f54bc7c7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
