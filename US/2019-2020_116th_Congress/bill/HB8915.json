Specifically, the potential threat to human health and the environment associated with local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including those exacerbated by climate change, must be taken into account when selecting remedial actions. Under current law, some remedial actions result in hazardous substances remaining at the site, so there must be a review every five years to assure that human health and the environment are being protected. The bill requires such review to include an assessment of whether the selected remedial action remains protective after taking into account local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including those exacerbated by climate change.","pending_committee_id":2551,"committee":{"committee_id":2551,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-12-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2020-12-10","committee_id":2551,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-12-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9023,"person_hash":"6f2n6oig","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Emanuel Cleaver","first_name":"Emanuel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cleaver","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-5","ftm_eid":4396432,"votesmart_id":39507,"opensecrets_id":"N00026790","knowwho_pid":226522,"ballotpedia":"Emanuel_Cleaver","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2893","sast_bill_id":1284506}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13332,"subject_name":"Atmospheric science and weather"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13442,"subject_name":"Natural disasters"},{"subject_id":13426,"subject_name":"Pollution liability"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2223491,"date":"2020-12-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8915\/id\/2223491","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8915\/BILLS-116hr8915ih.pdf","text_size":280695,"text_hash":"aa4a3691670ac926c3979a9069a2a083"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
