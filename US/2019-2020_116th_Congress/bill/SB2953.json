Specifically, the bill requires the State Department to submit to Congress any agreement with Taliban officials related to counterterrorism assurances by the Taliban, U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, and the status of intra-Afghan negotiations and a comprehensive cease-fire. Following the finalization of an agreement with Taliban officials, the State Department must report on Taliban officials' compliance with obligations and commitments under the agreement, whether Taliban officials and the Haqqani Network have broken ties with Al Qaeda, the viability of the intra-Afghan governing agreement, and whether the terms of the cease-fire are being met by all sides in the conflict. In addition, the President must submit a biannual report assessing whether key tenets of such agreement with Taliban officials are preserved and honored.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-21","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11080,"person_hash":"t1iqdrnz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Todd Young","first_name":"Todd","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":7157141,"votesmart_id":120345,"opensecrets_id":"N00030670","knowwho_pid":284637,"ballotpedia":"Todd_Young","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13630,"subject_name":"Afghanistan"},{"subject_id":13683,"subject_name":"Alliances"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13424,"subject_name":"International law and treaties"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13868,"subject_name":"Rule of law and government transparency"},{"subject_id":13463,"subject_name":"Sovereignty, recognition, national governance and status"},{"subject_id":13431,"subject_name":"Terrorism"},{"subject_id":13769,"subject_name":"Women's education"},{"subject_id":13327,"subject_name":"Women's employment"},{"subject_id":13581,"subject_name":"Women's rights"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2071953,"date":"2019-12-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2953\/id\/2071953","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2953\/BILLS-116s2953is.pdf","text_size":349847,"text_hash":"f35f59ad64727feeccb397e3f834c925"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2020-05-14","time":"09:30","location":"SR-325","description":"Senate Foreign Relations Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2020-05-21","time":"10:30","location":"SR-325","description":"Senate Foreign Relations Hearing"}]}}
