state laws (regarding scope of practice), rather than other specific requirements; (2) allows rural health clinics to serve as the distant site for purposes of telehealth services; and (3) beginning in 2020, increases the maximum payment rate per visit for rural health clinics.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
