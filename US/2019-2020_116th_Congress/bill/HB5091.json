In awarding grants, FEMA must give priority to state and local governments, Indian tribes, and joint authorities that will carry out projects or plans supporting a low-income community in a fire-hazard area or a severe disaster impacted community in a fire-hazard area. The GAO shall publish (1) a report on authorities and programs that are available to protect communities from wildfires; and (2) a study on the potential for a community wildfire defense plan to qualify for a certification identifying a level of wildfire survivability and resilience, and how to incentivize insurance companies to accept the certification. The Forest Service shall develop and publish a map depicting at-risk communities. FEMA shall prepare a report relating to insufficient radio frequencies, barriers to interoperability of radio frequencies, and available products and technologies for overcoming barriers to interoperability for wildland fire management.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and
