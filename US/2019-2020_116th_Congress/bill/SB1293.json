The State Department shall facilitate employment of such spouses by providing regular career counseling, maintaining a centralized database of the skills of such spouses and available employment opportunities, and offering other employment-related assistance. (Currently, the State Department is authorized to provide such assistance but not required to do so.) The State Department shall establish a program to help such spouses access employment and education opportunities, modeled after already-authorized programs for military spouses. The State Department shall report to Congress on the status of the implementation of the Foreign Service Family Reserve Corps (a program designed to speed up the hiring process for eligible family members of overseas Foreign Service officers), including (1) an update on the implementation of a hiring preference for Corps members, and (2) an accounting of any Corps-eligible individuals who were unable to fill a position at new location due to an inability to transfer a security clearance. Family members of overseas government employees shall not be held to a higher employment standard for positions customarily filled by Foreign Service officers, Foreign Service personnel, or foreign nationals.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-02","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9141,"person_hash":"52gl0w7n","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chris Van Hollen","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Hollen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":5552236,"votesmart_id":6098,"opensecrets_id":"N00013820","knowwho_pid":195215,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Van_Hollen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16523,"person_hash":"urkh79kr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Dan Sullivan","first_name":"Dan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sullivan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":39833727,"votesmart_id":114964,"opensecrets_id":"N00035774","knowwho_pid":328336,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_S._Sullivan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15418,"person_hash":"0wvwru9t","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Kaine","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kaine","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":5743146,"votesmart_id":50772,"opensecrets_id":"N00033177","knowwho_pid":140385,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Kaine","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13786,"subject_name":"Commuting"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13488,"subject_name":"Marriage and family status"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2018133,"date":"2019-05-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1293\/id\/2018133","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1293\/BILLS-116s1293is.pdf","text_size":333641,"text_hash":"2a9ad638fa78fed68a3c198ca918bef9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
