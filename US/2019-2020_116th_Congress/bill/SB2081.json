Rebates are calculated based on the number of units sold and the amount by which the manufacturer price exceeds inflation. The bill's requirements do not apply to drugs that cost less than $100 annually per user in 2020 (and as adjusted for inflation annually thereafter) or to drugs on a specified drug shortage list. The bill also eliminates cost-sharing for such drugs for beneficiaries whose out-of-pocket costs meet or exceed a specified threshold.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-10","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9415,"person_hash":"m7c3vp1o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Debbie Stabenow","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stabenow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MI","ftm_eid":10688869,"votesmart_id":515,"opensecrets_id":"N00004118","knowwho_pid":205511,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Stabenow","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2046821,"date":"2019-07-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2081\/id\/2046821","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2081\/BILLS-116s2081is.pdf","text_size":261805,"text_hash":"ada54971a20dec3eac7e4ab500f1ccc5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
