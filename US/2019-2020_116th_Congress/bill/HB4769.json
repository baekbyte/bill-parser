Among other things, the plan must (1) serve the entire United States; and (2) be the default plan for enrollees under the Medicare prescription drug benefit, unless the enrollee chooses another plan. Additionally, the CMS must negotiate prices for prescription drugs that are covered under the plan and, if appropriate, encourage the use of more affordable therapeutic equivalents. (Currently, the CMS is prohibited from negotiating the prices of covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.) The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality must assess the clinical benefits of drugs and make recommendations to the CMS regarding price negotiations, based on specified information (e.g., comparable international prices).","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-21","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-10-22","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8988,"person_hash":"2vo8uaxr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Janice Schakowsky","first_name":"Janice","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Schakowsky","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-9","ftm_eid":6419995,"votesmart_id":6387,"opensecrets_id":"N00004724","knowwho_pid":158836,"ballotpedia":"Jan_Schakowsky","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB2650","sast_bill_id":1277380}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2059024,"date":"2019-10-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4769\/id\/2059024","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4769\/BILLS-116hr4769ih.pdf","text_size":349913,"text_hash":"023c33abd54e658ffc7938abd5a7a3c8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
