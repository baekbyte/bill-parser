The Department of Energy (DOE) must complete a national plan for smart manufacturing technology development and deployment to improve the productivity and energy efficiency of the U.S. manufacturing sector. DOE must revise the plan biennially to account for advancements in information and communication technology and manufacturing needs. DOE may make grants to states for supporting the implementation of smart manufacturing technologies. States must use those grants to (1) provide access to shared supercomputing facilities to small- and medium-sized manufacturers, (2) fund research and development of transformational manufacturing processes and materials technology that advance smart manufacturing, and (3) provide tools and training to aid the adoption of energy management systems and implement smart manufacturing technologies in the manufacturers' facilities. DOE must expand the scope of technologies covered by Industrial Assessment Centers to (1) include smart manufacturing technologies and practices, and (2) equip the centers' directors with the training and tools necessary to provide technical assistance in smart manufacturing technologies and practices. DOE must (1) study how it can increase access to existing high-performance computing resources in the National Laboratories, and (2) facilitate access to the laboratories by small- and medium-sized manufacturers.","pending_committee_id":2933,"committee":{"committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-07","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-08","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9630,"person_hash":"sibgm7xn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Reed","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Reed","suffix":"II","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-23","ftm_eid":17657549,"votesmart_id":127046,"opensecrets_id":"N00030949","knowwho_pid":284901,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Reed_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB715","sast_bill_id":1234586}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13512,"subject_name":"Industrial facilities"},{"subject_id":13898,"subject_name":"Industrial policy and productivity"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":20684,"subject_name":"Materials"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1974781,"date":"2019-03-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1633\/id\/1974781","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1633\/BILLS-116hr1633ih.pdf","text_size":295165,"text_hash":"c439243d19e8e77a951ec728e759bb10"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
