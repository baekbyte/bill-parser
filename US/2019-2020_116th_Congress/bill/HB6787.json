The amount of such credit is 50% of the pandemic-related expenses of essential employees and 30% for other employees. The amount of expenses taken into account for purposes of the credit for any employee may not exceed $5,000 in any calendar quarter. The bill defines qualified pandemic-related employee benefit expenses as amounts paid to an employee that are excludible from gross income as disaster relief payments related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and that the employee has elected to treat as a pandemic-related expense. The credit is not allowed to the federal government or its agencies, except for tax-exempt organizations.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9121,"person_hash":"7ammm44v","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Linda Sanchez","first_name":"Linda","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"Sanchez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-38","ftm_eid":17657762,"votesmart_id":29674,"opensecrets_id":"N00024870","knowwho_pid":211684,"ballotpedia":"Linda_S%C3%A1nchez","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6800","sast_bill_id":1365578}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13226,"subject_name":"Income tax exclusion"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2188671,"date":"2020-05-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6787\/id\/2188671","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6787\/BILLS-116hr6787ih.pdf","text_size":320129,"text_hash":"bd5b3c56b5ecf330d7d770685598370e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
