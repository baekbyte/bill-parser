Russell, or any other lawmaker who intentionally disavowed the Declaration of Independence's exhortation that all persons are created equal; and (3) calls on the Senate to rename the Russell Senate Office Building for an honoree who embraced equality for all Americans, and to revert to using the building's original name, the Old Senate Office Building, until the Senate selects such
