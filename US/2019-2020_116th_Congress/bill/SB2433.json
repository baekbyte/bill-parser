Specifically, the bill allows companies engaged in the qualifying sale of a broadcast station to receive favorable tax treatment by electing nonrecognition of the gain or loss resulting from the sale. To qualify for this treatment, the sale must result in or preserve ownership of a broadcast station by socially disadvantaged individuals. The bill also requires the FCC to foster investment in broadcast stations owned by socially disadvantaged individuals.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-01","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19529,"person_hash":"ygy5eihl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Doug Jones","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Jones","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AL","ftm_eid":15183709,"votesmart_id":176464,"opensecrets_id":"N00024817","knowwho_pid":625255,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Jones_(Alabama)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3957","sast_bill_id":1272141}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13137,"subject_name":"Broadcasting, cable, digital technologies"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13498,"subject_name":"Capital gains tax"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13634,"subject_name":"Federal Communications Commission (FCC)"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13587,"subject_name":"Income tax deferral"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13703,"subject_name":"Women in business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2050652,"date":"2019-08-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2433\/id\/2050652","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2433\/BILLS-116s2433is.pdf","text_size":370202,"text_hash":"604e26f6ffe305407734cc7bac1d1163"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
