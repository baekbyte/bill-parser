Under current law, the President must notify Congress of the proposed transfer of certain defense articles or services to another country, and Congress typically has 30 days to pass a joint resolution to block the transfer. The bill specifies that such transfers to India are subject to only a 15-day window for Congress to block the transfer. The bill also authorizes the President to (1) reduce or waive certain administrative and research costs related to the sale of defense articles or services to India; and (2) provide to India services related to the transfer of defense articles or services, such as quality inspection, without charge. The bill expands existing annual reporting requirements relating to the U.S.-India defense partnership to include a description of the progress made in implementing existing agreements between the two countries, including the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign
