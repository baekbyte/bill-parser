In awarding these grants, HRSA shall prioritize minority-serving institutions or those that propose to establish or expand schools in medically underserved communities or areas with shortages of health professionals where no such schools exist. Grant recipients must use funds to recruit and retain students with backgrounds that are generally underrepresented in health care professions (i.e., members of racial or ethnic minority groups or first-generation college students) and for curriculum development that emphasizes care for rural and underserved populations. They may also use funds for other purposes, including constructing facilities, conducting activities to achieve accreditation, and hiring faculty.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-30","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
