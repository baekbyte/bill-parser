Covered individuals include U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents, aliens in possession of a visa, and refugees. The Department of Homeland Security shall ensure that a covered individual subject to secondary or deferred inspection has a meaningful opportunity to consult with counsel and certain related parties, such as a relative, within an hour of the start of the secondary inspection and as necessary during the inspection process. The counsel and related party shall be allowed to advocate on behalf of the covered individual, including by providing evidence and information to the examining immigration officer. A lawful permanent resident subject to secondary or deferred inspection may not abandon lawful permanent resident status until the individual has had a reasonable opportunity to seek advice from counsel, unless the individual voluntarily and knowingly waives in writing this opportunity to seek counsel's advice.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-10","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2020-01-17","committee_id":3982,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations"},{"date":"2020-01-28","committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-17","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-28","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-11","action":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-12","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-12","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended).","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-05","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Judiciary.
