No U.S. agency or department may arrest an individual based solely on an INTERPOL notice without (1) prior validation of the individual's eligibility for extradition, (2) a diplomatic request for arrest from the requesting country, and (3) an arrest warrant. A U.S. agency or department may not use an INTERPOL communication from an INTERPOL member country that does not have a bilateral extradition treaty with the United States as the sole basis for certain actions, such as detaining an individual or denying an individual a visa, without verifying that the communication likely comports with INTERPOL's constitution. The bill requires reports on countries that abuse INTERPOL communications for political motives and other unlawful purposes.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-13","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},{"date":"2019-09-23","committee_id":4016,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security"},{"date":"2019-10-02","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-16","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
