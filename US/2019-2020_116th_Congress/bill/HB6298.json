Specifically, USDA may grant waivers allowing participants under WIC to get certified or recertified without being physically present at a WIC clinic; defer anthropometric and bloodwork requirements necessary to determine nutritional risk; and grant waivers from administrative requirements for WIC if it determines that the requirement cannot be met by a state due to COVID-19, and the waiver is necessary to provide assistance under WIC.
