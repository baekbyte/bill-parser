An alien shall be inadmissible if a consular officer, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), or the Department of Justice knows or has reason to believe that the individual is or was a criminal gang member, or has participated or aided such a group's illegal activities. An alien who is or was a member of such a gang, or has participated or aided such a group's illegal activities, shall be deportable. Such individuals shall be subject to mandatory detention, shall not be eligible for asylum, temporary protected status, or special immigrant juvenile visas and shall not be eligible for parole unless they are assisting the government in a law enforcement matter. The bill defines a criminal gang as a group of five or more persons (1) where one of its primary purposes is the commission of specified criminal offenses and the members of which engage or have engaged within the past five years in a continuing series of such offenses, or (2) that has been designated as a criminal gang by DHS. The bill establishes procedures for DHS to designate a group such status, including notification to Congress, publication in the Federal Register, and an opportunity for the group to petition for administrative and judicial review.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9175,"person_hash":"gmwmkrf2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Vern Buchanan","first_name":"Vern","middle_name":"","last_name":"Buchanan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-16","ftm_eid":17658661,"votesmart_id":66247,"opensecrets_id":"N00027626","knowwho_pid":250707,"ballotpedia":"Vern_Buchanan","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20124,"person_hash":"rdxharuy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ron Wright","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wright","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-6","ftm_eid":44105354,"votesmart_id":78666,"opensecrets_id":"N00042240","knowwho_pid":206142,"ballotpedia":"Ronald_Wright","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB574","sast_bill_id":1153893},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1106","sast_bill_id":1196828},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB599","sast_bill_id":1227221}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13345,"subject_name":"Drug trafficking and controlled substances"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13656,"subject_name":"Juvenile crime and gang violence"},{"subject_id":13741,"subject_name":"Organized crime"},{"subject_id":13343,"subject_name":"Violent crime"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13418,"subject_name":"Judicial review and appeals"},{"subject_id":13475,"subject_name":"Refugees, asylum, displaced persons"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1846899,"date":"2019-01-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB98\/id\/1846899","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr98\/BILLS-116hr98ih.pdf","text_size":269598,"text_hash":"1c449291e9f3faaf2bb5d55839d7a04d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
