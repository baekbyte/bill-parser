The bill also requires the Department of the Treasury to remit all U.S.-assessed contributions to the World Health Organization. The envoy must develop and implement a diplomatic strategy that addresses, among other things (1) the development of medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases; (2) zoonotic (animal-to-human transmission) disease prevention, detection, and response; (3) the development of disease surveillance systems; and (4) efforts to combat the spread of disinformation and discrimination related to the outbreak and spread of infectious disease. The envoy shall regularly convene (1) an interagency steering committee to aid in the development, coordination, and implementation of this strategy; and (2) an outside panel of experts to advise on scientific, technical, and policy matters and to make recommendations for the diplomatic strategy.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-30","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13881,"subject_name":"Animal and plant health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13475,"subject_name":"Refugees, asylum, displaced persons"},{"subject_id":13450,"subject_name":"United Nations"},{"subject_id":13863,"subject_name":"World health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2200914,"date":"2020-07-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4118\/id\/2200914","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4118\/BILLS-116s4118is.pdf","text_size":320601,"text_hash":"51afc7965bad9a855e108eaa102376e4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
