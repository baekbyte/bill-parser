The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. The amendment requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber of Congress to levy a new tax, increase the rate of any tax, or increase the debt limit. The amendment provides any Member of Congress with standing and a cause of action to seek judicial enforcement of this amendment if authorized by a petition signed by one-third of the Members of either house of Congress. Courts are prohibited from ordering any increase in revenue to enforce this amendment.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-30","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16468,"person_hash":"gs8koi0n","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barry Loudermilk","first_name":"Barry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loudermilk","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-11","ftm_eid":12999116,"votesmart_id":31618,"opensecrets_id":"N00035347","knowwho_pid":228409,"ballotpedia":"Barry_Loudermilk","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14083,"person_hash":"77upbgbj","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doug Collins","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-9","ftm_eid":6671754,"votesmart_id":67851,"opensecrets_id":"N00033518","knowwho_pid":249158,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Collins","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
