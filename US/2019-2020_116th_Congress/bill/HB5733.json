Current law exempts from foreign agent registration requirements any person engaging only in religious, scholastic, or scientific pursuits. The bill eliminates this exemption for agents of foreign principals that are known violators of human rights. The bill also narrows the definition of foreign principal, waiving registration requirements for agents of foreign enterprises that are not under the control or direction of a foreign government or political party. The bill further requires registration statements and supplements to be filed in a digitized format and stored in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable database. In addition, the bill authorizes DOJ to enact a civil penalty of up to $200,000 for a violation of foreign agent registration requirements. Lastly, the bill transfers administration of lobbyist registration, reporting, disclosure and enforcement, and penalties from Congress to DOJ.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-30","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16498,"person_hash":"etwlc6gj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Seth Moulton","first_name":"Seth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moulton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-6","ftm_eid":25004670,"votesmart_id":146299,"opensecrets_id":"N00035431","knowwho_pid":464944,"ballotpedia":"Seth_Moulton","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18288,"person_hash":"prykhtgd","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Banks","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Banks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-3","ftm_eid":2949733,"votesmart_id":116801,"opensecrets_id":"N00037185","knowwho_pid":291462,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Banks_(Indiana)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13538,"subject_name":"Art, artists, authorship"},{"subject_id":81061,"subject_name":"Charitable contributions"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13159,"subject_name":"Department of Justice"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13592,"subject_name":"Political parties and affiliation"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2119637,"date":"2020-02-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5733\/id\/2119637","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5733\/BILLS-116hr5733ih.pdf","text_size":326765,"text_hash":"47403d0a705a1b8bf66fa4a74bde0e81"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
