Current law makes such individuals ineligible for premium and cost-sharing subsidies, but establishes a process for U.S. territories to apply for financial assistance with respect to the provision of Medicare prescription drugs. The bill retains a process for U.S. territories to apply for such assistance, but alters the formula by which the amount of assistance is calculated. Specifically, the bill phases in modifications to the formula that more closely align how assistance is calculated for U.S. territories with how it is calculated for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-20","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-08-21","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-20","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-21","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18411,"person_hash":"k3rdw8m0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon","first_name":"Jenniffer","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gonzalez-Colon","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PR","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":47514,"opensecrets_id":"N00037615","knowwho_pid":221612,"ballotpedia":"Jenniffer_Gonz%C3%A1lez-Col%C3%B3n","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18332,"person_hash":"fizx4b9o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darren Soto","first_name":"Darren","middle_name":"","last_name":"Soto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-9","ftm_eid":198924,"votesmart_id":67618,"opensecrets_id":"N00037422","knowwho_pid":255376,"ballotpedia":"Darren_Soto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049508,"date":"2019-08-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4195\/id\/2049508","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4195\/BILLS-116hr4195ih.pdf","text_size":362227,"text_hash":"dde36263599fe8e2069063c433e1e7cd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
