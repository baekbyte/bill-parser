A covered veteran is a veteran who is enrolled in the VA health care system and has not received health care furnished or paid for by the VA in the past two years. Under the bill, if a covered veteran elects to receive more than one of the comprehensive examinations at a VA health care facility, the VA shall seek to furnish all such examinations on the same day. A covered veteran may also receive an examination from another specified health care provider. The bill provides that the VA may pay for a rural covered veteran to travel to a health care facility to receive a comprehensive examination. The VA shall seek to enter into agreements with non-profit organizations to provide shuttle service to rural covered veterans for such examinations.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-02","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-08-22","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-02","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-02","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20078,"person_hash":"3v5vyjqg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzanne Lee","first_name":"Suzanne","middle_name":"Kelley","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"Susie","district":"HD-NV-3","ftm_eid":9713907,"votesmart_id":169344,"opensecrets_id":"N00037247","knowwho_pid":541030,"ballotpedia":"Susie_Lee","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20122,"person_hash":"zyhgh5uc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Watkins","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Watkins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-2","ftm_eid":45399292,"votesmart_id":181200,"opensecrets_id":"N00042126","knowwho_pid":643123,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Watkins","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16482,"person_hash":"09m0eusv","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lee Zeldin","first_name":"Lee","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zeldin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-1","ftm_eid":6684704,"votesmart_id":110252,"opensecrets_id":"N00029404","knowwho_pid":267328,"ballotpedia":"Lee_Zeldin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20120,"person_hash":"nuddykio","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Van Drew","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Drew","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-2","ftm_eid":6389812,"votesmart_id":24685,"opensecrets_id":"N00042164","knowwho_pid":209970,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Van_Drew","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8247","sast_bill_id":1377889}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13608,"subject_name":"Hearing, speech, and vision care"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13644,"subject_name":"Transportation costs"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049105,"date":"2019-08-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4154\/id\/2049105","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4154\/BILLS-116hr4154ih.pdf","text_size":359438,"text_hash":"685f1390b56329ea4890a346a2a920f9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
