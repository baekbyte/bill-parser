Currently, such visas are capped nationally at 66,000 a year. For positions in states that had a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 3.5% or lower in three of the five most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly reports issued in the previous fiscal year, a certain number of H-2B visas may be issued that don't count against the 66,000 per year cap. For such exempted H-2B visas, a state may receive each year no more than 125% of the number of visas for aliens working in the state in the last completed fiscal year or 2,500, whichever is less.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-15","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-15","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9492,"person_hash":"xyfooh2c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Thune","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thune","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SD","ftm_eid":19897787,"votesmart_id":398,"opensecrets_id":"N00004572","knowwho_pid":159061,"ballotpedia":"John_Thune","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16521,"person_hash":"0gww5x7w","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Rounds","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rounds","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SD","ftm_eid":6580808,"votesmart_id":7455,"opensecrets_id":"N00035187","knowwho_pid":198882,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Rounds","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13191,"subject_name":"Foreign labor"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1878149,"date":"2019-01-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB135\/id\/1878149","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s135\/BILLS-116s135is.pdf","text_size":124433,"text_hash":"4ce1a2333335a83d552708f7704b8466"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
