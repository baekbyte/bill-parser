Specifically, the waiver shall apply to a Mexican national who is (1) eligible for nonimmigrant admission into the United States, (2) exempt from visa and passport requirements or certain existing (and generally more limited) arrival-departure card requirements, and (3) admitted at a port of entry in Arizona on the U.S.-Mexico border for visiting Arizona for up to 30 days. The waiver program shall be in effect for five years. Before the program expires, DHS shall report to Congress on issues including (1) the estimated economic impact of the program, and (2) the number of Mexican nationals who overstayed their visa in Arizona during the first four years in which the program was in effect.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-11","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":21702,"person_hash":"c8fd3zmw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Kelly","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":48160599,"votesmart_id":190594,"opensecrets_id":"N00044223","knowwho_pid":709398,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Kelly","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB5405","sast_bill_id":1288228}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13536,"subject_name":"Arizona"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13235,"subject_name":"Latin America"},{"subject_id":13243,"subject_name":"Mexico"},{"subject_id":13533,"subject_name":"Travel and tourism"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2079899,"date":"2019-12-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3022\/id\/2079899","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3022\/BILLS-116s3022is.pdf","text_size":324874,"text_hash":"a0d016cd147634d17b8179f5d1d73947"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
