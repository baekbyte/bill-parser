Specifically, the bill permits an Indian tribe to nominate a corridor within the land of such tribe as a tribal wildlife corridor. The Department of the Interior must establish criteria for determining whether such a corridor qualifies as a tribal wildlife corridor, including criteria for restoring historical habitat. Interior must provide tribes with technical assistance to establish, manage, or expand a tribal wildlife corridor. Such assistance must include support with accessing wildlife data and working with private landowners to access programs for facilitating connectivity on nonfederal land. Additionally, Interior must (1) establish a program to award grants to tribes to increase connectivity through tribal wildlife corridors, and (2) consult with tribes to determine whether a tribal wildlife corridor may be expanded into public lands or otherwise benefit connectivity between public lands and such corridor. The bill also permits the Department of Agriculture to give priority under certain conservation programs to those projects that enhance connectivity by expanding a tribal wildlife corridor.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-19","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-12-06","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},{"date":"2019-12-11","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-06","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-06","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported by the Yeas and Nays: 22 - 15.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-09","action":"Reported by the Committee on Natural Resources.
