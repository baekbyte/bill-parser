Specifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine the overall reduction in the national quantity of renewable fuel as a result of exemptions granted to small refineries in 2006-2018. The EPA must increase the renewable fuel standard (RFS) by adding such reductions to future year RFS obligations.","pending_committee_id":4135,"committee":{"committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-21","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-06-24","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-21","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9284,"person_hash":"k56piu5q","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve King","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-4","ftm_eid":6587767,"votesmart_id":10853,"opensecrets_id":"N00025237","knowwho_pid":193968,"ballotpedia":"Steve_King_(Iowa)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2043786,"date":"2019-06-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3411\/id\/2043786","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3411\/BILLS-116hr3411ih.pdf","text_size":364334,"text_hash":"c5050fa222fe2cf7191abc6b40a666a0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
