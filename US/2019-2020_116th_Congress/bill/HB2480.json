Specifically, the bill establishes requirements concerning collecting and exchanging data about child abuse and neglect. For instance, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to (1) establish uniform national standards for tracking and reporting child fatalities and near-fatalities resulting from maltreatment, and (2) develop an electronic interstate data exchange system that allows states to share information from their child abuse and neglect registries with other states. In addition, the bill addresses child abuse and neglect related to families impacted by substance use disorders, racial bias in the child protective services system, and child sexual abuse. Finally, the bill requires HHS to examine unregulated custody transfers and make recommendations for preventing, identifying, and responding to such transfers.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-02","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-02","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-02","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-20","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Education and Labor.
