The bill also prohibits the funds from being used unless the funding is provided in advance in an appropriations bill. The bill includes exceptions for funds to be paid to a whistle-blower, loan guarantee programs, and insurance programs. The requirements do not apply to the U.S. Postal Service or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Department of Commerce and the USPTO must report annually to Congress on funds collected by the USPTO from a settlement. The bill also requires offsetting receipts and collections to be treated as revenue for the purpose of carrying out the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other laws. (Offsetting receipts and collections are funds collected by agencies from other government accounts or from the public in businesslike or market-oriented transactions. Under current law, the collections are treated as negative budget authority and outlays rather than revenue and may be used to offset spending for budget enforcement purposes.)","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-14","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9496,"person_hash":"gcopvn6m","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Risch","first_name":"James","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Risch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":6576171,"votesmart_id":2919,"opensecrets_id":"N00029441","knowwho_pid":213702,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Risch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16520,"person_hash":"pw88booc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"David Perdue","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perdue","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":12377537,"votesmart_id":151330,"opensecrets_id":"N00035516","knowwho_pid":474720,"ballotpedia":"David_Perdue","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15313,"person_hash":"kkwugc78","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ted Cruz","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cruz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":210204,"votesmart_id":135705,"opensecrets_id":"N00033085","knowwho_pid":378522,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Cruz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11080,"person_hash":"t1iqdrnz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Todd Young","first_name":"Todd","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":7157141,"votesmart_id":120345,"opensecrets_id":"N00030670","knowwho_pid":284637,"ballotpedia":"Todd_Young","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB850","sast_bill_id":1180278}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13152,"subject_name":"Department of Commerce"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13614,"subject_name":"Intellectual property"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2030546,"date":"2019-05-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1456\/id\/2030546","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1456\/BILLS-116s1456is.pdf","text_size":329384,"text_hash":"0bcb62825be75581fc49205ab07697e6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
