The Office of Aviation and International Affairs must determine whether the bombing was a proximate cause of Pan American's bankruptcy. If the office finds such proximate cause, then the Department of the Treasury must establish a fund to compensate qualifying victims of the bombing (generally, former employees of Pan American who were part of an earlier lawsuit seeking compensation from Libya for the bombing). The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission must establish a process for claimants to apply for compensation from the fund.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-09","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-09","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
