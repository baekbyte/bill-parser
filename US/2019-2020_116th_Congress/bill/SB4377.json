This research must address, among other topics, the transmissibility of the virus among children and adults and the vulnerability of children to COVID-19 while travelling to and from school, playing sports, and engaging in other extramural activities. It may also address the vulnerability to COVID-19 of adults who live with children and the types of personal protective equipment appropriate for students, teachers, and other staff in school buildings. In undertaking this research, the NIH must ensure that it takes into consideration certain demographic and other characteristics, such as race or ethnicity and health or economic status. The NIH must, within six months, report findings on this research and disseminate best practices for protecting those in educational settings. The NIH must update its findings and best practices quarterly through the end of the declared COVID-19 emergency.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-30","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20294,"person_hash":"1lllgwva","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Braun","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Braun","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":21084493,"votesmart_id":148564,"opensecrets_id":"N00041731","knowwho_pid":484213,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Braun","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13217,"subject_name":"Homelessness and emergency shelter"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13702,"subject_name":"School athletics"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205463,"date":"2020-08-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4377\/id\/2205463","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4377\/BILLS-116s4377is.pdf","text_size":308186,"text_hash":"155fa4bfbb3c02f80ce9ff8d17b2c32d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
