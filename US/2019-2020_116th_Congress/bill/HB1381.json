The Department of Veterans Affairs established the burn pit registry to allow certain veterans and servicemembers to document their exposures and report health concerns. The registry is for individuals who may have been exposed to toxic airborne chemicals and fumes caused by open burn pits (areas used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment) while deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq. Specifically, the bill authorizes a designee of a registered individual or an immediate family member to update the registry with the cause of death of the individual.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-26","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-03-01","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-26","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-26","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-01","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
