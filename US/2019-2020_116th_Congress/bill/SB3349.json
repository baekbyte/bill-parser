NOAA must provide the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with mesoscale meteorological information when appropriate or upon request by NIST. NIST must publish the information and advise and provide technical assistance to organizations that develop standards, model building codes, or voluntary certifications in order for such organizations to appropriately use the information. The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in coordination with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group, shall designate a working group to identify and support research that enables such forward-looking long-term meteorological information.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-27","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5994","sast_bill_id":1352770}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13332,"subject_name":"Atmospheric science and weather"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13442,"subject_name":"Natural disasters"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2158500,"date":"2020-03-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3349\/id\/2158500","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3349\/BILLS-116s3349is.pdf","text_size":325018,"text_hash":"fb04e73b8b795da8d82e0425ce764afb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
