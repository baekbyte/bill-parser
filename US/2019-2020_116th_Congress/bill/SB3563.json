The bill modifies the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) to require USDA to (1) notify retailers of the existing opportunities through which they can deliver groceries to SNAP participants; and (2) authorize public-private partnerships between itself, authorized SNAP retailers, and community-based organizations to support grocery delivery during the national emergency regarding COVID-19. The bill provides funding for USDA to support grocery delivery for SNAP participants who are seniors, immunocompromised individuals, or other individuals who are unable to travel safely to a grocery store. Additionally, the bill (1) extends the certification period under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) for infants to two years, instead of the current one year; and (2) authorizes states to increase the certification time under WIC for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women to two years postpartum. The bill also allows any federal agency charged with the administration of a federal assistance program to modify or waive administrative conditions during an emergency.","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-22","committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6445","sast_bill_id":1362548}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177754,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3563\/id\/2177754","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3563\/BILLS-116s3563is.pdf","text_size":322137,"text_hash":"f8abb9ebb0dac8c9fee9dd3b004ff58f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
