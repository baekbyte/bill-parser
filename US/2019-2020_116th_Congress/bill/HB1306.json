Not later than two years after enactment of this bill, FEMA shall convene a working group on a regular basis to (among other things) identify (1) potential areas of duplication or fragmentation in preliminary damage assessments after disaster declarations; and (2) potential emerging technologies, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (i.e., drones), to expedite the administration of preliminary damage assessments. FEMA must submit a comprehensive report on the plans for streamlining and consolidating information collection and preliminary damage assessments and the findings and recommendations of the working group to Congress with a briefing. The report must be made available to the public and posted on FEMA's website.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-15","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-02-19","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"},{"date":"2019-10-29","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-19","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
