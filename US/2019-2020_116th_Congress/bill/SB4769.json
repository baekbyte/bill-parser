Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services must issue guidance for states and local health departments on collecting data on pregnancy and postpartum status in conjunction with COVID-19 tests. In addition, the bill provides funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to expand particular maternal health surveillance programs. The CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must also publish pregnancy and postpartum data related to COVID-19, and the CDC and the Indian Health Service must consult with tribes about collecting this data for tribal populations. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration must collect information about the effects of COVID-19 therapeutics on pregnant and postpartum individuals. The NIH must also ensure that at least one vaccine will be suitable for that population and must support related research. In addition, the Department of Labor must implement an emergency temporary standard to protect employees from workplace exposures to the virus that causes COVID-19 that specifically addresses pregnant and postpartum individuals. Certain regulatory requirements shall not apply in developing this standard. The CDC must also carry out an education campaign about pregnancy and COVID-19 and must establish a task force that addresses maternity care during the COVID-19 emergency. Furthermore, the Government Accountability Office must report on maternal health and public health emergency preparedness.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And
