Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education to award grants to eligible states and Native American tribes to pay the federal share (75% of the average resident community college tuition and fees per student) of a program that provides funds to community colleges for waiving resident tuition and fees. The bill also requires each state to ensure that a participating institution offers academic credits that are fully transferable to a four-year institution. In addition, the bill establishes a grant program to encourage certain minority group students to enroll in and complete baccalaureate programs by requiring a university that receives grant funding to waive or significantly reduce tuition and fees for such students.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
