The bill prohibits social media companies from using infinite scroll, auto refill, and autoplay functions and restricts them from giving users awards for higher levels of engagement. The bill further instructs social media companies to automatically limit users' time spent on their platforms across all devices to a default of 30 minutes per day and to implement regular stopping points designed to end scrolling after 3 minutes. Social media companies are also charged to conspicuously display a notification at least twice an hour showing users how much time they have spent on the platform that day.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-30","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13887,"subject_name":"Digital media"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047898,"date":"2019-08-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2314\/id\/2047898","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2314\/BILLS-116s2314is.pdf","text_size":378223,"text_hash":"856c5c8715f1f151ed3d3a7793974f06"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
