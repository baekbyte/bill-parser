A national of Vietnam shall qualify for deferral if that individual (1) has been ordered removed to Vietnam before this bill's enactment, and (2) resided in the United States on or before July 12, 1995. An otherwise qualifying alien shall not receive deferral if (1) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that the alien's removal is necessary because the alien is directly responsible for specific and significant harm to national security, or (2) the alien is subject to extradition. The deferral period shall be for 24 months starting from this bill's enactment. An alien receiving deferral under this bill shall receive work authorization and shall not be detained based on the alien's immigration status. DHS shall notify each Vietnamese national with a final order of removal about the provisions of this bill.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-28","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-28","action":"Introduced
