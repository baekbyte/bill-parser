Each agency shall make face masks available at each entrance to a federal facility at which such agency maintains a presence. The bill terminates such requirements when the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases determines, and publishes in the Federal Register a notification, that the requirement to wear a mask is no longer necessary to prevent such transmission.","pending_committee_id":4010,"committee":{"committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development,
