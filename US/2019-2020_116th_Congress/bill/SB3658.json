OERCI shall be responsible for improving underserved community access to disaster assistance and improving the quality of assistance such communities receive; eliminating racial, ethnic, and other underserved community disparities in the delivery of various preparedness, response, and recovery assistance; and carrying out such other responsibilities of the previous Office of Equal Rights as in effect on the day before the enactment of this bill as determined appropriate by FEMA. The bill defines underserved community to mean an historically disadvantaged community, including the Native American, African-American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern and North African, and rural communities. OERCI may award specified grants and enter into memoranda of understanding with state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies. It shall develop measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its activities aimed at reducing disparities in preparedness, response, and recovery. During the period of time for which there is a major disaster or emergency declared by the President with respect to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), OERCI shall regularly consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal government officials and community-based organizations from underserved communities that it identifies as disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-07","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
