USDA shall conduct such an activity on National Forest System land in a manner that attains multiple ecosystem benefits, including reducing forest fuels and maintaining biological diversity. However, a forest management activity shall not be conducted if the costs associated with attaining such benefits are excessive. Additionally, the USDA shall (1) establish any post-program ground condition criteria for a ground disturbance caused by a forest management activity required by the applicable forest plan, and (2) provide for monitoring to ascertain the attainment of relevant post-program conditions. The bill categorically excludes certain forest management activities for reducing forest fuels from certain environmental impact requirements. For a specified period, USDA or the Department of the Interior, as appropriate, in conjunction with land adjustment programs, may enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with a qualified entity to provide for fuel reduction, erosion control, reforestation, Stream Environment Zone restoration, and similar management activities on federal lands and nonfederal lands within such programs.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and
