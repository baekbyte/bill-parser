Specifically, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must award cooperative agreements to specified organizations to provide person- and family-centered care for such individuals, particularly through collaboratives with providers and community-based organizations. Participants may receive waivers from certain coverage requirements (e.g., Medicare hospice, skilled nursing facility, and home health services requirements) to implement program initiatives and must report data using identified quality measures.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-14","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9443,"person_hash":"jgbb1oef","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sheldon Whitehouse","first_name":"Sheldon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Whitehouse","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-RI","ftm_eid":373538,"votesmart_id":2572,"opensecrets_id":"N00027533","knowwho_pid":248425,"ballotpedia":"Sheldon_Whitehouse","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13128,"subject_name":"Aging"},{"subject_id":13645,"subject_name":"Cancer"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13673,"subject_name":"Digestive and metabolic diseases"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13436,"subject_name":"Neurological disorders"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1979656,"date":"2019-04-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB829\/id\/1979656","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s829\/BILLS-116s829is.pdf","text_size":301568,"text_hash":"bceb556d7a9326dc83d8aed43f80e944"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
