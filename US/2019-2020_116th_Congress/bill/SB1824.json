Hong Kong is a part of China but has a mostly separate legal system, which includes protection for civil liberties such as free speech and freedom from arbitrary imprisonment. The United States and Hong Kong have a bilateral relationship separate from the U.S.-China relationship, based in part on the existence of Hong Kong's separate legal and economic system. The report shall assess how the Chinese government extradites or coercively moves foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, from Hong Kong to mainland China. It shall also describe how China uses Hong Kong to avoid U.S. export controls, duties on imported goods, and sanctions. The State Department shall report on China's use of Hong Kong security agencies to (1) conduct espionage against foreign nationals, (2) conduct influence operations, and (3) violate civil liberties protected under Hong Kong law.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-12","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15313,"person_hash":"kkwugc78","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ted Cruz","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cruz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":210204,"votesmart_id":135705,"opensecrets_id":"N00033085","knowwho_pid":378522,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Cruz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4551","sast_bill_id":1275857},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4629","sast_bill_id":1378317}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":81060,"subject_name":"Espionage and treason"},{"subject_id":13922,"subject_name":"Hong Kong"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13611,"subject_name":"Sanctions"},{"subject_id":13678,"subject_name":"Tariffs"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2041517,"date":"2019-06-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1824\/id\/2041517","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1824\/BILLS-116s1824is.pdf","text_size":250731,"text_hash":"176639b9d3d4ca3161019d34307f087e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
