Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a program for expanding community solar energy options, including options for low-income and moderate-income individuals. In addition, DOE must expand existing grant, loan, and financing programs to include community solar projects as specified by the bill. Further, the bill revises requirements for electric utilities, including by requiring each electric utility to offer a community solar program. Finally, the bill allows the GSA to make a public utility contract for a period of up to 20 years. Currently, the GSA may make a public utility contract for up to 10 years.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-25","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8979,"person_hash":"s3k15nh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben Lujan","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"Ray","last_name":"Lujan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-3","ftm_eid":9025644,"votesmart_id":102842,"opensecrets_id":"N00029562","knowwho_pid":266495,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Lujan,_Sr.","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20068,"person_hash":"e1243zkk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debra Haaland","first_name":"Debra","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haaland","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8997515,"votesmart_id":149368,"opensecrets_id":"N00040933","knowwho_pid":491018,"ballotpedia":"Debra_Haaland","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13179,"subject_name":"Energy assistance for the poor and aged"},{"subject_id":13795,"subject_name":"Energy prices"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2153621,"date":"2020-02-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5968\/id\/2153621","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5968\/BILLS-116hr5968ih.pdf","text_size":328570,"text_hash":"0f9f4dc53d40477494b95f12e17ca04e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
