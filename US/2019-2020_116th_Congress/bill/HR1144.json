It also asserts that affordable broadband access enables the promotion and propagation of human rights, recognizes that this access promotes equal access for engagement in democracy, and reaffirms that the global and open nature of the internet is a driving force in progress toward development. Further, the resolution calls on the President to (1) preserve and build upon the technological leadership of the federal government and federal funding opportunities to provide all Americans with affordable broadband access, (2) ensure tribal sovereignty over access to electromagnetic spectrum on tribal lands, and (3) address the civil and human rights threats posed by a lack of affordable access to broadband in light of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-23","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20068,"person_hash":"e1243zkk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debra Haaland","first_name":"Debra","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haaland","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8997515,"votesmart_id":149368,"opensecrets_id":"N00040933","knowwho_pid":491018,"ballotpedia":"Debra_Haaland","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18314,"person_hash":"mapln5bo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ro Khanna","first_name":"Ro","middle_name":"","last_name":"Khanna","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-17","ftm_eid":373494,"votesmart_id":29473,"opensecrets_id":"N00026427","knowwho_pid":281537,"ballotpedia":"Ro_Khanna","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9069,"person_hash":"61we0po4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eddie Johnson","first_name":"Eddie","middle_name":"Bernice","last_name":"Johnson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-30","ftm_eid":17658377,"votesmart_id":27098,"opensecrets_id":"N00008122","knowwho_pid":159100,"ballotpedia":"Eddie_Bernice_Johnson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9117,"person_hash":"2m022k5d","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lucille Roybal-Allard","first_name":"Lucille","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roybal-Allard","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-40","ftm_eid":12450156,"votesmart_id":26766,"opensecrets_id":"N00006671","knowwho_pid":158750,"ballotpedia":"Lucille_Roybal-Allard","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9051,"person_hash":"x4hkzhov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Grijalva","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Grijalva","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-3","ftm_eid":17657668,"votesmart_id":28253,"opensecrets_id":"N00025284","knowwho_pid":211719,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Grijalva","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
