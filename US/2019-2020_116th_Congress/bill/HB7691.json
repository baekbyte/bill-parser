Earner Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act of 2020","description":"Allows states to provide pandemic unemployment assistance to individuals who earn a combination of regular wages and a minimum of $7,250 of self-employed annual income (1) instead of regular unemployment compensation if they are otherwise eligible, or (2) if they are still employed at their regular-wage job, but unable to earn self-employed income due to circumstances related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).Under current law, individuals earning such mixed income are only eligible for pandemic unemployment assistance if they are not eligible for regular unemployment and unable to work due to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":3987,"committee":{"committee_id":3987,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Worker and Family
