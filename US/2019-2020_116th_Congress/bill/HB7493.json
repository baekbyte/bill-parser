Specifically, the CMS must (1) identify services that are already covered by Medicare or Medicaid that could be provided in temporary family health care structures by caregivers, (2) determine reasonable reimbursement rates for such services, and (3) provide the cost differential between such rates and the rates for services provided in nursing facilities. The bill defines temporary family health care structure as a transportable residential structure that helps a caregiver (i.e., adult relative) of an individual who is mentally or physically impaired to care for the individual. The structure must have been primarily assembled at a different location from where it is installed, may be no larger than 300 gross square feet, and must be limited to only one occupant (the individual in need of care).","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-06","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-06","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
