The series must apply to the following positions forestry technician; range technician; other positions related to significant prevention, preparedness, control, suppression, or management activities for wildland firefighters; and other positions conducting activities necessary to meet any other emergency incident. The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture must use the series in the advertising and hiring of a wildland firefighter. The bill requires an employee in a wildland firefighter occupational series to receive a pay differential based on the unusual physical hardship or hazardous nature of the position. An individual employed as a wildland firefighter on the date on which the occupational series takes effect may (1) remain in the occupational series in which the individual is working, or (2) be included in the wildland firefighter occupational series.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-04","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15228,"person_hash":"pbm46q1a","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doug LaMalfa","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"","last_name":"LaMalfa","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-1","ftm_eid":1560957,"votesmart_id":29713,"opensecrets_id":"N00033987","knowwho_pid":211738,"ballotpedia":"Doug_LaMalfa","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16492,"person_hash":"c0i0lq89","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark DeSaulnier","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"DeSaulnier","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-11","ftm_eid":24686,"votesmart_id":69477,"opensecrets_id":"N00030709","knowwho_pid":248434,"ballotpedia":"Mark_DeSaulnier","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1682","sast_bill_id":1264488}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":22687,"subject_name":"Forests, forestry, trees"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207775,"date":"2020-09-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8170\/id\/2207775","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8170\/BILLS-116hr8170ih.pdf","text_size":301628,"text_hash":"23a0a6a71f330a43352bac5bda8a8e09"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
