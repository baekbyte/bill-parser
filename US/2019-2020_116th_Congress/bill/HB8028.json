The Department of Justice may bring a civil action against a private education lender for violations. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on the extent to which private education lenders discriminate against applicants who attend minority-serving IHEs.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-11","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15242,"person_hash":"e2quvx5g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Filemon Vela","first_name":"Filemon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vela","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-34","ftm_eid":17658451,"votesmart_id":137719,"opensecrets_id":"N00034349","knowwho_pid":405531,"ballotpedia":"Filemon_Vela_(Texas_U.S._representative)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13768,"subject_name":"Business ethics"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207135,"date":"2020-09-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8028\/id\/2207135","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8028\/BILLS-116hr8028ih.pdf","text_size":300405,"text_hash":"73afb65fec3d80c3109930e0aa97bf50"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
