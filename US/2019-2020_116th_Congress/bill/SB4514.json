Specifically, the bill requires the Department of State to establish a program to provide capacity-building assistance for law enforcement agencies of specified countries to identify, track, and detect certain synthetic drugs (e.g., fentanyl). The State Department must also carry out an international exchange program for drug demand reduction experts to provide educational and professional development on demand-reduction matters relating to the illicit use of narcotics and other drugs. The bill requires the State Department to include new sections in its annual international narcotics control strategy report that contain (1) an assessment of the countries likely involved in the trafficking of synthetic opioids; and (2) policies of responding to new psychoactive substances. The bill also expands the definition of major illicit drug producing country to include countries that produce synthetic drugs. Under current law, foreign assistance may be withheld from such countries.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9422,"person_hash":"cleoh36j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeanne Shaheen","first_name":"Jeanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shaheen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":2227644,"votesmart_id":1663,"opensecrets_id":"N00024790","knowwho_pid":209675,"ballotpedia":"Jeanne_Shaheen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11966,"person_hash":"d5cx9z5s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rob Portman","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Portman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3094681,"votesmart_id":27008,"opensecrets_id":"N00003682","knowwho_pid":159002,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Portman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7990","sast_bill_id":1375554}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13735,"subject_name":"Cultural exchanges and relations"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13345,"subject_name":"Drug trafficking and controlled substances"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13615,"subject_name":"International exchange and broadcasting"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13317,"subject_name":"Smuggling and trafficking"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13450,"subject_name":"United Nations"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2209422,"date":"2020-09-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4514\/id\/2209422","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4514\/BILLS-116s4514is.pdf","text_size":309508,"text_hash":"6a60dc847125b2b844014a7e8cac299d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
