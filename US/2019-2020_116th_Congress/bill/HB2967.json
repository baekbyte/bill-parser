Specifically, the bill provides that a child of a relative eligible for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefits is eligible for such benefit payments if that child (1) began living with such relative before age 18, (2) receives at least 50% of their support from such relative, and (3) has lived with such relative pursuant to a court order for at least 12 months.Additionally, the bill revises the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) eligibility requirements for children living with specified caretaker relatives. First, the bill lessens the requirement for TANF applicants to assign their rights to child support when such assignment may impact the likelihood of reunifying the child with their noncustodial parent, such as where the noncustodial parent is working to gain financial stability so they may reunify with their child. Further, when a child, but not the caretaker relative, receives TANF benefits (i.e., child-only cases), or if the caretaker relative is 55 or older, the bill (1) excludes such caretaker\u2019s income from that child\u2019s eligibility determination, (2) removes the 5-year cap on assistance, and (3) exempts such caretaker relatives from TANF work requirements.The bill also (1) encourages states to enact temporary guardianship laws, (2) establishes the National Technical Assistance Center on Grandfamilies, and (3) provides grants for state plans to support caretaker relatives.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-05-24","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9032,"person_hash":"fem2kor1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Danny Davis","first_name":"Danny","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-7","ftm_eid":16565454,"votesmart_id":233,"opensecrets_id":"N00004884","knowwho_pid":158834,"ballotpedia":"Danny_K._Davis","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1660","sast_bill_id":1264571}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13700,"subject_name":"Families"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13470,"subject_name":"Family relationships"},{"subject_id":20754,"subject_name":"Family services"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13274,"subject_name":"Separation, divorce, custody, support"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2032491,"date":"2019-06-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2967\/id\/2032491","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2967\/BILLS-116hr2967ih.pdf","text_size":293112,"text_hash":"6a49995d2a46656cd8de1a6d090a15b1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
