A high-risk wildlife market is a commercial market that sells or processes wildlife for human consumption where (1) the species of wildlife or regulation of the market is a risk factor for zoonotic (i.e., naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans) disease spread or is linked with the global illegal trade in wildlife, or (2) the manner of processing the wildlife is a risk factor for zoonotic disease spread. The Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) must (1) prioritize the closure of high-risk wildlife markets around the world, (2) provide support for foreign governments in their efforts to close such markets, (3) work with foreign governments and multilateral organizations to develop agreements around closing such markets, and (4) coordinate these activities with existing efforts to combat wildlife trafficking. Further, if a country is determined to be willfully harboring high risk wildlife markets, the President may impose certain sanctions, such as import bans. The State Department, the USAID, the FWS, USDA, and the U.S. Geological Survey must leverage public health, animal health, and environmental health expertise to, among other things (1) identify high-risk wildlife markets; (2) strengthen global capacity for detection of zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential; and (3) coordinate an approach to global zoonotic disease preparedness, surveillance, and response.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-19","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9624,"person_hash":"rsz1qtnd","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Coons","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Coons","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-DE","ftm_eid":5584171,"votesmart_id":122834,"opensecrets_id":"N00031820","knowwho_pid":286419,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Coons","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9488,"person_hash":"vxlaliuo","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lindsey Graham","first_name":"Lindsey","middle_name":"","last_name":"Graham","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SC","ftm_eid":8463292,"votesmart_id":21992,"opensecrets_id":"N00009975","knowwho_pid":159057,"ballotpedia":"Lindsey_Graham","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13881,"subject_name":"Animal and plant health"},{"subject_id":13482,"subject_name":"Animal protection and human-animal relationships"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13542,"subject_name":"Ecology"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13543,"subject_name":"Endangered and threatened species"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13521,"subject_name":"Food supply, safety, and labeling"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":26221,"subject_name":"Foreign property"},{"subject_id":13199,"subject_name":"Government ethics and transparency, public corruption"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13607,"subject_name":"Meat"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13611,"subject_name":"Sanctions"},{"subject_id":13317,"subject_name":"Smuggling and trafficking"},{"subject_id":13463,"subject_name":"Sovereignty, recognition, national governance and status"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"},{"subject_id":13753,"subject_name":"Veterinary medicine and animal diseases"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"},{"subject_id":13863,"subject_name":"World health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2193608,"date":"2020-06-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3759\/id\/2193608","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3759\/BILLS-116s3759is.pdf","text_size":322255,"text_hash":"a415e8876f595748084726a7f5a0d3a0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
