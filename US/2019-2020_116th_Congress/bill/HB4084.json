The Department of the Treasury shall restrict correspondent and payable-through accounts that are used to facilitate significant transactions or provide services to sanctioned entities, specifically North Korean financial institutions, companies, and certain North Korean individuals, such as those named in certain executive orders. (Correspondent and payable-through accounts are often maintained by foreign financial institutions in U.S. banks to access the U.S. financial system.) Treasury shall use its vote and voice in international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to oppose the provision of assistance by such institutions to governments that fail to enforce the sanctions provided under this bill. The Export-Import Bank may not guarantee, insure, or extend credit in relation to exports to entities sanctioned under this bill. Treasury shall support increasing use of the IMF administrative budget for technical assistance to help IMF members fight money laundering and funding for terrorism. Various sanctions and restrictions under this bill shall be suspended if the President certifies to Congress that (1) North Korea has committed to suspending its weapons of mass destruction programs and engaging in multilateral talks on limiting such programs, or (2) it is in U.S. national security interests to do so.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-26","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-26","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-26","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15051,"person_hash":"hme4jiwz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Garland Barr","first_name":"Garland","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barr","suffix":"","nickname":"Andy","district":"HD-KY-6","ftm_eid":9192076,"votesmart_id":117290,"opensecrets_id":"N00031233","knowwho_pid":284674,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Barr","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11143,"person_hash":"u6jyo8ie","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Stivers","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stivers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-15","ftm_eid":3672534,"votesmart_id":45333,"opensecrets_id":"N00029574","knowwho_pid":213916,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Stivers","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16463,"person_hash":"v6sesxl9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"French Hill","first_name":"French","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hill","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-2","ftm_eid":9620575,"votesmart_id":146290,"opensecrets_id":"N00035792","knowwho_pid":475052,"ballotpedia":"French_Hill","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2500","sast_bill_id":1256454},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1790","sast_bill_id":1267965},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR758","sast_bill_id":1288053},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4367","sast_bill_id":1274829}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13451,"subject_name":"Arms control and nonproliferation"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13613,"subject_name":"Foreign and international banking"},{"subject_id":13423,"subject_name":"Foreign loans and debt"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13849,"subject_name":"Multilateral development programs"},{"subject_id":13692,"subject_name":"North Korea"},{"subject_id":13529,"subject_name":"Nuclear weapons"},{"subject_id":13611,"subject_name":"Sanctions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049082,"date":"2019-08-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4084\/id\/2049082","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4084\/BILLS-116hr4084ih.pdf","text_size":383931,"text_hash":"8c08b8eaadedb7d674a642c486aa2087"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
