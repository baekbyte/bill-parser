The task force must provide reports and recommendations related to racial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) response to Congress and relevant federal agencies. First, the task force must report weekly on COVID-19 infections and patient outcomes with data disaggregated by race and ethnicity. The reports must also identify communities with high levels of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 measures and recommend how to allocate health care and other resources to address these disparities. Second, the task force must report biweekly on the disbursement of federal COVID-19 relief funds and how to use any undisbursed funds to address racial and ethnic disparities. Lastly, the task force must submit a final report that describes factors that contributed to racial and ethnic disparities with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, with recommendations to address them in responses to future infectious disease outbreaks. The task force terminates 90 days after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency . However, the bill permanently establishes a successor task force to address racial and ethnic disparities during future public health emergencies.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Small Business, Education and Labor, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Small Business, Education and Labor, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Small Business, Education and Labor, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Small Business, Education and Labor, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16022,"person_hash":"qfvt1amx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robin Kelly","first_name":"Robin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-2","ftm_eid":2665398,"votesmart_id":33384,"opensecrets_id":"N00035215","knowwho_pid":212680,"ballotpedia":"Robin_Kelly","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9021,"person_hash":"qs5uninn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Yvette Clarke","first_name":"Yvette","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Clarke","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-9","ftm_eid":5418023,"votesmart_id":44741,"opensecrets_id":"N00026961","knowwho_pid":248335,"ballotpedia":"Yvette_Clarke","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9078,"person_hash":"7ingxztp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barbara Lee","first_name":"Barbara","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-13","ftm_eid":1263932,"votesmart_id":8315,"opensecrets_id":"N00008046","knowwho_pid":158726,"ballotpedia":"Barbara_Lee_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
