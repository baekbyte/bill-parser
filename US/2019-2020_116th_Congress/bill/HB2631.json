To be eligible for designation, a consortium must include at least one (1) institution of higher education, (2) private sector entity, and (3) government entity. The consortium may define the region that it represents, as long as the region contains critical elements of key technologies or supply chain and enables close collaboration among the consortium's members. Each designation shall be for two years and may be renewed for up to two additional two-year periods. Support under the program shall include financial and technical assistance and preferential consideration when seeking such assistance.
