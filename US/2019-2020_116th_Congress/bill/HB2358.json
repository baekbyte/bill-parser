If there are insufficient funds to employ all U.S. citizens in the corps, the President must give preference in the hiring process to (1) unemployed veterans, (2) workers who have exhausted their unemployment compensation, and (3) other unemployed workers eligible for unemployment compensation. The President may provide housing and transportation services for corps employees. The bill prohibits discrimination in the employment of corps employees, but individuals convicted of a crime may not be employed in the corps.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-25","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
