The lactation room must be shielded from public view, be free from intrusion, and contain a chair, a working surface, and (if the building is supplied with electricity) an electrical outlet. A public building may be excluded from such requirement at the discretion of the official responsible for its operation if it does not contain a lactation room for employees and does not have a space that could be repurposed as one or that could be made private by using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or the cost of new construction required to create a lactation room is not feasible.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-26","action":"Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works discharged by Unanimous Consent.
