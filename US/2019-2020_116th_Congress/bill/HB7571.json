Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Agriculture must award grants for broadband infrastructure in frontier states to support the provision of mental health services via telehealth under Medicare.","pending_committee_id":3246,"committee":{"committee_id":3246,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2020-09-03","committee_id":2630,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Social Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Social Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9168,"person_hash":"c40vdlmx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Young","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AK","ftm_eid":17658637,"votesmart_id":26717,"opensecrets_id":"N00007999","knowwho_pid":158699,"ballotpedia":"Don_Young_(Alaska)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4211","sast_bill_id":1372553}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2203622,"date":"2020-08-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7571\/id\/2203622","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7571\/BILLS-116hr7571ih.pdf","text_size":304494,"text_hash":"c180f53f96ee3714986cec0b3a9a4dd5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
