These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the substances, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. The EPA must promulgate regulations to prohibit the disposal by incineration of foam that contains PFAS and is used to fight fire. In addition, the EPA must promulgate regulations (1) identifying additional wastes containing PFAS for which a prohibition on incineration may be necessary to protect human health and the environment, and (2) prohibiting such disposal of the identified wastes.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy
