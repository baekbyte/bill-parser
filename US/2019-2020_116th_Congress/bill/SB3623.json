Specifically, the bill provides funding for FY2020 for units of local government with a population of 500,000 or less. Payment shall be made within 30 days after submission of a specified certification by the locality. The amount of the payment is proportional to the population. Local governments shall use the funds provided to cover only those costs that (1) such governments reasonably deem to be necessary and related to the public health emergency caused by COVID-19, and (2) were incurred during the period of March 1-December 30, 2020. If a unit of local government determines it will not expend all the funds paid by the end of that period, it may transfer the unexpended portion to another unit of local government in the state with a population of 500,000 or less, subject to specified requirements. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury shall conduct monitoring and oversight of the receipt, disbursement, and use of
