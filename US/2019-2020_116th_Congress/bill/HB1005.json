A burn pit is an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment. The VA must provide a process for veterans who receive compensation due to a service-connected disability to have their disability reevaluated based on the diagnostic code and evaluation criteria established for obliterative bronchiolitis. Such veterans may then be assigned a new disability rating as a result of such reevaluation if such assignment does not reduce the veteran's existing disability rating.","pending_committee_id":2597,"committee":{"committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial
