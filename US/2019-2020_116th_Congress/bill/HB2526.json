The bill allows territories to terminate their public, unsecured debt if they meet two of three criteria: the population of the territory has decreased by more than 5% over 10 years, the territory received major federal disaster assistance, or the territory's per capita debt exceeds $15,000. If Puerto Rico discharges its debt under this process, the bill provides funding that a special master must allocate to certain creditors whose debts were discharged. The bill also establishes a Puerto Rico Public Credit Comprehensive Audit Commission.","pending_committee_id":2310,"committee":{"committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural
