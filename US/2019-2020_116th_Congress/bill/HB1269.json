Specifically, remedies will be limited to injunctive and declaratory relief for claims where the deprivation of rights consists of violation of a prohibition in the Constitution against the establishment of religion. Additionally, no attorney's fees shall be awarded in proceedings in vindication of civil rights with respect to such a claim concerning the actions of states and localities. With regard to a claim brought against the United States or a federal official acting in his or her official capacity, the bill prohibits the award of reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys to the prevailing party.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil
