Specifically, the bill removes the manifestation period required for the presumption of service-connection for chloracne and porphyria cutanea tarda. Additionally, the bill provides statutory authority for a presumption of service-connection for certain cases of acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy without a manifestation period. Under a presumption of service-connection, specific disabilities diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.","pending_committee_id":2597,"committee":{"committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability
