The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must provide adequate health care, provide videoconferencing free of charge, train employees to identify trauma-related health needs, and make specified health products (e.g., tampons) available free of charge. Additionally, with respect to prisoners who are primary caretaker parents, the BOP must provide parenting classes, allow visitation from family members, and establish a pilot program to allow overnight visits from family members. Finally, the bill allows a prisoner who is pregnant or a primary caretaker parent to participate in a residential substance abuse treatment program, even if the individual failed to disclose a substance abuse problem.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-02","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9405,"person_hash":"i4x14koe","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Durbin","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Durbin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":3414130,"votesmart_id":26847,"opensecrets_id":"N00004981","knowwho_pid":165219,"ballotpedia":"Dick_Durbin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2034","sast_bill_id":1248149}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13159,"subject_name":"Department of Justice"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13470,"subject_name":"Family relationships"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13349,"subject_name":"Sex and reproductive health"},{"subject_id":13288,"subject_name":"Telecommunication rates and fees"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1990260,"date":"2019-04-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB992\/id\/1990260","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s992\/BILLS-116s992is.pdf","text_size":171011,"text_hash":"3257af43a99e1a52a27886611ee8c179"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
