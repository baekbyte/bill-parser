The DHS Inspector General shall conduct various oversight activities into immigration detention facilities, including (1) periodic unannounced inspections; (2) audits to ensure compliance with various legal requirements; and (3) investigations into issues such as deaths in custody, detainee access to medical and mental health care, and sexual assault and harassment. DHS may not continue a contract with any facility deemed less than adequate in two of the most recent inspector general inspections, audits, or investigations. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within DHS shall (1) investigate civil rights and civil liberties complaints in immigration detention facilities, and (2) periodically release on a public website data about such complaints and investigations. The bill requires various reports to Congress, including a DHS plan for decreasing the number of immigration detention beds and implementing community-based alternatives to detention.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-23","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3906","sast_bill_id":1271910}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13781,"subject_name":"Assault and harassment offenses"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13196,"subject_name":"Government buildings, facilities, and property"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048133,"date":"2019-08-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2221\/id\/2048133","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2221\/BILLS-116s2221is.pdf","text_size":370831,"text_hash":"003591e1e002f2d684bdf7427cd86330"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
