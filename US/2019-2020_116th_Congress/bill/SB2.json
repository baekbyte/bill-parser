The bill directs the Department of Commerce to prohibit the export of certain U.S. technology and intellectual property to China. The bill places a shareholder cap on Chinese investments in certain U.S. corporations. Federal agencies are prohibited from using or procuring telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation, or any other entity reasonably believed to be owned or controlled by China. The bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to list certain Chinese products that receive support pursuant to China's Made in China 2025 policy. The bill expedites the countervailing duty process (i.e., the imposition of duties to offset a subsidy by a foreign government) for products on such a list. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) repeal certain reduced withholding rates for residents of China, and (2) tax income received by China from certain U.S. investments.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-27","action":"Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
