The bill allows a maximum credit amount of $4,500 ($2,250 for a married individual filing a separate return). A \"scholarship granting organization\" is a tax-exempt entity whose exclusive purpose is to provide scholarships for the tuition and other education expenses of elementary and secondary school students from low-income households (i.e., household income not exceeding 250% of federal poverty guidelines). The bill allows corporate taxpayers a tax credit, up to $100,000, for contributions to a scholarship granting organization. It also imposes a penalty on scholarship granting organizations that fail to distribute at least 90% of their total receipts for elementary and secondary school expenses in a taxable year.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":81061,"subject_name":"Charitable contributions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1839945,"date":"2019-01-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB5\/id\/1839945","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s5\/BILLS-116s5is.pdf","text_size":265300,"text_hash":"5c78020628911285380b6c09e165b67f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
