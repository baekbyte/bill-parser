Specifically, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must use the fund to support institutions of higher education (IHEs) in providing broadband internet access service, videoconferencing systems and services used for distance learning, and equipment (e.g., computers, Wi-Fi hotspots, and other one-time costs) to enrolled students during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. The bill requires the NTIA, in consultation with the Department of Education, to promulgate regulations within 14 days related to support for IHEs. Among other things, the regulations must prioritize support for IHEs that receive certain institutional grants, including historically Black colleges and universities, minority-serving institutions, and rural-serving institutions; require IHEs to prioritize support for students who are eligible for need-based financial aid; and establish a schedule of reasonable per-student funding amounts for eligible services and equipment.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-12","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8971,"person_hash":"ksn2rrxb","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anna Eshoo","first_name":"Anna","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Eshoo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-18","ftm_eid":8050793,"votesmart_id":26741,"opensecrets_id":"N00007335","knowwho_pid":158731,"ballotpedia":"Anna_Eshoo","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8983,"person_hash":"ti6l1nze","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doris Matsui","first_name":"Doris","middle_name":"O.","last_name":"Matsui","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-6","ftm_eid":17658638,"votesmart_id":28593,"opensecrets_id":"N00027459","knowwho_pid":232639,"ballotpedia":"Doris_Matsui","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
