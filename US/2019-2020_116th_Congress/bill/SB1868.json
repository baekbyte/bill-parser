Similarly, an invisible high-risk pool generally identifies and enrolls higher-risk individuals and the state program pays a percentage of any insurance claims of such enrollees that exceed a predetermined amount. In states that do not establish such programs, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must make market stabilization payments to health insurance issuers. The bill further directs HHS to expedite the review of state innovation waiver applications that include a high-risk pool or reinsurance program. States may model a waiver application on the application of a state that has an approved waiver for such a program.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9459,"person_hash":"f0qn5jvf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Collins","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":10045641,"votesmart_id":379,"opensecrets_id":"N00000491","knowwho_pid":165234,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Collins_(Maine)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9625,"person_hash":"7pac6cxl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joe Manchin","first_name":"Joe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Manchin","suffix":"III","nickname":"","district":"SD-WV","ftm_eid":7573477,"votesmart_id":7547,"opensecrets_id":"N00032838","knowwho_pid":219013,"ballotpedia":"Joe_Manchin_III","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13487,"subject_name":"Insurance industry and regulation"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2042057,"date":"2019-06-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1868\/id\/2042057","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1868\/BILLS-116s1868is.pdf","text_size":257781,"text_hash":"1c4dec6b2893f54d5f0652e2b33cd8e4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
