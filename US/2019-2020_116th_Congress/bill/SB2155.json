Among other things, the bill increases financial and legal liability for these funds in the event of certain violations of law, gives employee compensation higher priority in bankruptcies, and generally prohibits the payment of dividends for two years from an acquired asset firm to a private equity fund. The bill modifies the tax treatment of carried interest\u2014compensation that is typically received by a partner of a private equity fund and is based on a share of the fund's profits. (Under current law, carried interest is taxed as investment income rather than at ordinary income tax rates.) Among other things, the bill treats as ordinary income the net capital gain with respect to a private equity fund.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-17","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3848","sast_bill_id":1271690},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1735","sast_bill_id":1238891},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB781","sast_bill_id":1238952}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13498,"subject_name":"Capital gains tax"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13508,"subject_name":"Real estate business"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13666,"subject_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"},{"subject_id":13504,"subject_name":"Self-employed"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047850,"date":"2019-08-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2155\/id\/2047850","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2155\/BILLS-116s2155is.pdf","text_size":527350,"text_hash":"d29e213c38835413417fda0600b3c5e0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
