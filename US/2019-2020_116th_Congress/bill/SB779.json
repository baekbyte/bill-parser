The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand reporting requirements for certain foreign investments and accounts held by U.S. persons, establish a rebuttable presumption against the validity of transactions by institutions that do not comply with reporting requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, treat certain foreign corporations managed and controlled primarily in the United States as domestic corporations for tax purposes, treat swap payments sent offshore as taxable U.S. source income, require reporting of United States beneficial owners of foreign-owned financial accounts, impose additional requirements for third party summonses used to obtain information in tax investigations that do not identify the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued (i.e., John Doe summons), and modify the rules for the taxation of inverted corporations (U.S. corporations that acquire foreign companies to reincorporate in a foreign jurisdiction with income tax rates lower than the United States). The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to (1) require corporations to disclose certain financial information on a country-by-country basis, and (2) impose penalties for failing to disclose offshore holdings. The bill makes investment advisers and persons engaged in forming new business entities subject to new anti-money laundering requirements.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-13","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9443,"person_hash":"jgbb1oef","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sheldon Whitehouse","first_name":"Sheldon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Whitehouse","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-RI","ftm_eid":373538,"votesmart_id":2572,"opensecrets_id":"N00027533","knowwho_pid":248425,"ballotpedia":"Sheldon_Whitehouse","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9422,"person_hash":"cleoh36j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeanne Shaheen","first_name":"Jeanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shaheen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":2227644,"votesmart_id":1663,"opensecrets_id":"N00024790","knowwho_pid":209675,"ballotpedia":"Jeanne_Shaheen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1712","sast_bill_id":1238916},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1711","sast_bill_id":1238931},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2140","sast_bill_id":1271660}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13659,"subject_name":"Federal district courts"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13613,"subject_name":"Foreign and international banking"},{"subject_id":13365,"subject_name":"Foreign and international corporations"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13445,"subject_name":"Jurisdiction and venue"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13370,"subject_name":"Taxation of foreign income"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1980188,"date":"2019-04-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB779\/id\/1980188","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s779\/BILLS-116s779is.pdf","text_size":369997,"text_hash":"c1ae826b05e6fdae54b424ba3deb22c7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
