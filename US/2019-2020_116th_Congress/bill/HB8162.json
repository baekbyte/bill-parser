Specifically, ED should carry out the exceptions published in a notice on September 3, 2020, by allowing eligible entities (e.g., local educational agencies and community-based organizations) that are awarded program subgrants for community learning centers to use these subgrants to (1) carry out activities that advance student academic achievement and support student success, regardless of whether such activities are conducted in person, virtually, during school hours, or when school is in session; and (2) provide in-person care during the regular school day and when full-time in-person instruction is not available to students. (Currently, the program only supports academic enrichment opportunities for children during non-school hours or periods when school is not in session.)","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-04","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},{"date":"2020-09-17","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Ms. Wild moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
