Child care assistance may only be provided once for a child and for a period shorter than six months, but the VA is authorized to waive such limitations. The term eligible veteran is defined as a veteran who is the primary caretaker of a child and (1) who is receiving VA training or vocational rehabilitation on a full-time basis, or needs and would receive such training or rehabilitation from the VA but for the lack of child care; and (2) whose family's adjusted gross income meets certain criteria. The bill provides for various types of child care assistance, as the VA considers appropriate.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-07","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB5045","sast_bill_id":1280066}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"},{"subject_id":81057,"subject_name":"Vocational and technical education"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2070375,"date":"2019-11-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2825\/id\/2070375","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2825\/BILLS-116s2825is.pdf","text_size":329635,"text_hash":"3feda39d57a5cdcfbb6ec7bd0e00f8a2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
