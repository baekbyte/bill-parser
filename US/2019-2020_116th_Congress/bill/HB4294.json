federal lands within their borders; limits the President's authority to prohibit oil and gas leasing on the OCS; establishes a revenue sharing framework to distribute revenues collected from oil and gas leasing on the OCS to certain states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alaska); provides a mechanism for states to receive their entitled percentage of sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals for all public land or deposits located in the state; requires the Department of the Interior to establish certain federal land as geothermal and wind energy leasing priority areas; and limits the authority of Interior to declare a moratorium on the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas activities unless such moratorium is authorized by Congress.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and
