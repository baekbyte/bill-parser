The bill extends to certain reservists specified program requirements that currently apply to service members separating from active duty. Specifically, the bill requires certain members of a reserve component who have previously served on active duty to be provided with both a physical examination and a mental health assessment prior to separation. Under current law, only a physical examination must be offered to such reservists, and the examination is optional. The bill also specifies the time period during which the pre-separation physical examination and mental health assessment must occur. Specifically, a service member must undergo a physical examination and mental health assessment during the 90-day period before the service member's separation from the Armed Forces. In addition, the bill requires pre-separation counseling to include a plan for a service member's achievement of health care objectives.","pending_committee_id":2299,"committee":{"committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-08","committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Armed Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15054,"person_hash":"g7jsudzc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tulsi Gabbard","first_name":"Tulsi","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gabbard","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-2","ftm_eid":6401344,"votesmart_id":129306,"opensecrets_id":"N00033281","knowwho_pid":378573,"ballotpedia":"Tulsi_Gabbard","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13251,"subject_name":"National Guard and reserves"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2069464,"date":"2019-11-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4993\/id\/2069464","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4993\/BILLS-116hr4993ih.pdf","text_size":330594,"text_hash":"08856efdc62725541ff574583c0d819e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
