Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the formation. Specifically, this bill subjects the underground injection of such fluids or propping agents to regulation under state underground injection control programs, which protect drinking water. In addition, the bill (1) requires the Bureau of Land Management to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations on federal land administered by the Department of the Interior, and (2) establishes permit requirements for such operations.","pending_committee_id":2367,"committee":{"committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-10","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18332,"person_hash":"fizx4b9o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darren Soto","first_name":"Darren","middle_name":"","last_name":"Soto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-9","ftm_eid":198924,"votesmart_id":67618,"opensecrets_id":"N00037422","knowwho_pid":255376,"ballotpedia":"Darren_Soto","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1878090,"date":"2019-01-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB484\/id\/1878090","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr484\/BILLS-116hr484ih.pdf","text_size":124895,"text_hash":"32ef6ba1e6951c2debe2207160622f78"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
