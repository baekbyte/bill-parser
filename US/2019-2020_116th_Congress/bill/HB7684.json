A burn pit is an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment. If such an evaluation establishes that an individual was based or stationed at a location where an open burn pit was used, or that the individual was exposed to toxic airborne chemicals or contaminants, the individual must be enrolled in the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry unless they opt out of enrollment. The VA's Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence must conduct a study on the health impacts of infection with a virus designated as a global pandemic, including the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19), to members of the Armed Forces and veterans who have been exposed to open burn pits and other toxic exposures. The study must be analyzed to assist in preparation for potential future pandemics.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-20","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2020-09-30","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-30","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20067,"person_hash":"omf1h5se","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jared Golden","first_name":"Jared","middle_name":"","last_name":"Golden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-ME-2","ftm_eid":23424266,"votesmart_id":151420,"opensecrets_id":"N00041668","knowwho_pid":372438,"ballotpedia":"Jared_Golden","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6395","sast_bill_id":1361898},{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3868","sast_bill_id":1368147},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HR1271","sast_bill_id":1388768}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13630,"subject_name":"Afghanistan"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13359,"subject_name":"Conflicts and wars"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13447,"subject_name":"Iraq"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13448,"subject_name":"Middle East"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13449,"subject_name":"Military operations and strategy"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2204343,"date":"2020-08-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7684\/id\/2204343","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7684\/BILLS-116hr7684ih.pdf","text_size":305928,"text_hash":"327f43fda4fc737d6849f0bc52d7d338"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
