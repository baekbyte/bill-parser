In the case of the loss of uncut timber from fire, storm, other casualty, or theft, the basis used for determining the amount of the deduction may not be less than the excess of (1) the fair market value of the uncut timber determined immediately before the loss was sustained, over (2) the salvage value of the timber. The rule applies only if (1) the timber was held for the purpose of being cut and sold, and (2) the uncut timber subject to the loss is reforested within five years of the loss. The bill also exempts casualty losses from uncut timber from the rule restricting the deduction for personal casualty losses to losses attributable to a federally declared disaster.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Read
