It establishes an employee cybersecurity education tax credit for an employer who incurs costs for an employee who earns a certain cybersecurity certificate or degree. If a business claims such a credit, then executive agencies must award a score increase to each competitive proposal submitted by the business for a federal contract valued at more than $5 million. In addition, the Department of Education may cancel eligible student loans for borrowers who have (1) made 36 consecutive monthly payments, and (2) held a cybersecurity job in an economically distressed area during at least 12 months of payments. Finally, the bill makes cybersecurity course instructors eligible for awards under the CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service program.","pending_committee_id":3059,"committee":{"committee_id":3059,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Research and
