Similarly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must revise its regulations to require jurisdictions that receive funding from HUD to include information relating to veterans in their consolidated plans. HUD must also conduct an assessment of the housing needs of very low-income veteran families and report annually on its activities relating to veterans.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9050,"person_hash":"mk25m4b8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Al Green","first_name":"Al","middle_name":"","last_name":"Green","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-9","ftm_eid":11567524,"votesmart_id":49680,"opensecrets_id":"N00026686","knowwho_pid":226547,"ballotpedia":"Al_Green_(Texas)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13261,"subject_name":"Public housing"},{"subject_id":13382,"subject_name":"Veterans' loans, housing, homeless programs"},{"subject_id":13375,"subject_name":"Housing and community development"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13704,"subject_name":"Housing supply and affordability"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1854547,"date":"2019-01-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB165\/id\/1854547","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr165\/BILLS-116hr165ih.pdf","text_size":252790,"text_hash":"05775892e1791e587172f95ae9e4909d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
