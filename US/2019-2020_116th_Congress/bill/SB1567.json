(Endemic fungal diseases are fungal infections, e.g., Valley fever, that tend to to occur in specific geographic areas and affect particular at-risk populations, e.g., older adults.)Specifically, the bill establishes the Endemic Fungal Disease Working Group to review, coordinate, and make recommendations about the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) efforts to address endemic fungal diseases. The working group is comprised of experts from both relevant federal agencies and the private sector. The bill requires HHS to award grants for fungal disease research to local hospitals, higher education institutions, public health agencies, and nonprofit organizations. HHS also must establish an accelerated research program modeled after its research program to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria.The bill further requires the National Institutes of Health to develop a publicly-accessible server using blockchain technology to securely facilitate the sharing of fungal disease clinical research data. (Blockchain technology uses cryptography to create a digital ledger of transactions that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large, decentralized, and permanent network.)Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must prioritize the review of drugs to treat endemic fungal diseases and fast track the approval of such drugs at the request of applicants. The FDA must issue draft and final guidance related to the approval of antifungal products and therapies, including those that diagnose, treat, or prevent Valley fever.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2858","sast_bill_id":1263645}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13787,"subject_name":"Food and Drug Administration (FDA)"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2032793,"date":"2019-06-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1567\/id\/2032793","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1567\/BILLS-116s1567is.pdf","text_size":268490,"text_hash":"852cba94e5f3dcfbd472f0c8e740b0a0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
