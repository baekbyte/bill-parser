(Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.) The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities. Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid).","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9408,"person_hash":"r7nps3ip","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Amy Klobuchar","first_name":"Amy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klobuchar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":17659011,"votesmart_id":65092,"opensecrets_id":"N00027500","knowwho_pid":248506,"ballotpedia":"Amy_Klobuchar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1046","sast_bill_id":1196686}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1926842,"date":"2019-02-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB377\/id\/1926842","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s377\/BILLS-116s377is.pdf","text_size":285180,"text_hash":"2be0677158c0994c4cdd45e8f2eca1e3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
