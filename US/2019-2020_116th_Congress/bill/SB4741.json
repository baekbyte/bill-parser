ICE may not transfer an individual between ICE facilities until the COVID-19 transmission rate in the United States meets or drops below a certain threshold. In addition, ICE may not apprehend or transfer an individual between an ICE detention facility and a facility operated by an outside entity, such as a state or local prison, unless the individual is tested for COVID-19 and placed in quarantine (1) for 14 consecutive days, or (2) until the test comes back negative. These two requirements shall not prohibit the transfer of (1) an individual solely to process that individual's release from custody, or (2) a minor from ICE custody to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. If ICE cannot ensure compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 (including maintaining social distancing requirements at all times) in any ICE facility, ICE shall (1) immediately review the custody of all detained individuals in that facility, and (2) release individuals found eligible for release.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-29","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9463,"person_hash":"ldf3b0fy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Michael Bennet","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Bennet","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5995587,"votesmart_id":110942,"opensecrets_id":"N00030608","knowwho_pid":274906,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Bennet","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8799","sast_bill_id":1383827}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13196,"subject_name":"Government buildings, facilities, and property"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213444,"date":"2020-10-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4741\/id\/2213444","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4741\/BILLS-116s4741is.pdf","text_size":298650,"text_hash":"1d260d887f9ff1cf89e0c6d5d9303abc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
