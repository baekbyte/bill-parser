States must consider requiring that, as a part of a supply side resource planning process, electric utilities in the states demonstrate that they considered an investment in energy storage systems based on factors such as cost, improved reliability, security, and system performance and efficiency. The Department of Energy (DOE) must coordinate efforts among various existing programs conducting energy storage research at DOE.","pending_committee_id":2933,"committee":{"committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-13","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-14","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15239,"person_hash":"2abxxyrw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Takano","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Takano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-41","ftm_eid":17657771,"votesmart_id":22337,"opensecrets_id":"N00006701","knowwho_pid":378804,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Takano","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14135,"person_hash":"5nf6fekr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chris Collins","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-27","ftm_eid":4978019,"votesmart_id":139770,"opensecrets_id":"N00001285","knowwho_pid":413516,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Collins_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20105,"person_hash":"pj9a15df","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abigail Spanberger","first_name":"Abigail","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spanberger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-7","ftm_eid":44045205,"votesmart_id":179682,"opensecrets_id":"N00041418","knowwho_pid":630216,"ballotpedia":"Abigail_Spanberger","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9051,"person_hash":"x4hkzhov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Grijalva","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Grijalva","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-3","ftm_eid":17657668,"votesmart_id":28253,"opensecrets_id":"N00025284","knowwho_pid":211719,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Grijalva","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1976941,"date":"2019-03-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1744\/id\/1976941","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1744\/BILLS-116hr1744ih.pdf","text_size":277479,"text_hash":"1cc534fecf70a87f025870559e7517de"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
