Specifically, the bill revises the affordability requirement to allow states to provide coverage of comparable affordability to what is available through the federal health insurance exchange.Further, the reviewing agencies may consider the budgetary impact of a state waiver program on other federal programs (e.g., Medicaid) when determining whether the waiver application would increase the federal deficit. Additionally, the bill applies the budget-neutrality requirement over the term of the waiver period.States may certify that a governor has the authority to apply for a waiver under current state law, as an alternative to referencing a specific state statute. The bill also provides expedited review and approval of state applications that are substantially similar to a waiver program that already has been approved.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-04-10","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18320,"person_hash":"foub2xo0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Roger Marshall","first_name":"Roger","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Marshall","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-1","ftm_eid":8816503,"votesmart_id":172080,"opensecrets_id":"N00037034","knowwho_pid":536160,"ballotpedia":"Roger_Marshall","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2004071,"date":"2019-04-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2183\/id\/2004071","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2183\/BILLS-116hr2183ih.pdf","text_size":310241,"text_hash":"bd8adddb4258a2f3654fd2293ad3aa89"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
