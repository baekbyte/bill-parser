The working group shall lead executive branch actions to improve the understanding of and preparation for space weather phenomena and the coordination of federal space weather activities. The Office of Science and Technology Policy must develop a strategy for coordinated observation of space weather by working group agencies. The advisory group shall receive advice from specified stakeholders, including the commercial space weather sector, to inform the interests and work of the working group. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shall work with federal and international partners to secure reliable back-up capability for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery and other relevant observations required for space weather forecasts. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, and NASA shall each pursue multidisciplinary research in subjects that further the understanding of solar physics, space physics, and space weather. The roundtable shall facilitate communication and knowledge transfer among government participants in the working group, the academic community, and the commercial space weather sector. The working group shall periodically review and update the benchmarks identified as Space Weather Phase I Benchmarks.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-22","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And
