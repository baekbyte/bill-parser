Specifically, the bill prohibits certain transactions such as acquisitions (1) by firms with over $100 million in revenue; (2) by financial institutions or equity funds with over $100 million in capitalization; and (3) involving firms with exclusive patents pertaining to COVID-19 pandemic-related production, manufacturing, distribution, or infrastructure. However, a waiver may be granted if the participating firms demonstrate that the transaction will advance critical national security, economic, or public health interests during the emergency. Further, the bill establishes a legal presumption against a transaction that may pose a risk to the government's ability to respond to the national emergency declared due to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-18","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6989","sast_bill_id":1367009}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13614,"subject_name":"Intellectual property"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13727,"subject_name":"Product development and innovation"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13945,"subject_name":"Strategic materials and reserves"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2200086,"date":"2020-07-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4013\/id\/2200086","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4013\/BILLS-116s4013is.pdf","text_size":310346,"text_hash":"c01822309f994dc88b2b5def1edca46b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
