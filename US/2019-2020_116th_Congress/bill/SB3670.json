The comprehensive management plan that is to be prepared for such segments pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act must provide for public involvement, including consultation with tribal governments. Any nonfederal land within or adjacent to such a segment that is acquired by the United States shall be incorporated in, and be administered as part of, the applicable segment.
