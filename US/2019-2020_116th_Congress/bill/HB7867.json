Among other provisions, the bill sets forth requirements relating to the use of masks and other protective equipment for airline passengers and certain airline employees; requires the FAA to provide certain employees, including any air traffic controller and airway transportation systems specialist, with masks and other protective equipment; mandates the development of a national aviation preparedness plan to ensure the aviation system is prepared to respond to epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases; directs each air carrier operating an aircraft with a seating capacity of 20 or more to implement appropriate measures on a flight in air transportation for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of any passenger or crewmember contracting an infectious disease; requires the FAA to enter into an agreement with the National Academies to conduct a study on the transmission of infectious diseases, including airborne diseases, in the cabins of passenger airplanes; and establishes a Center of Excellence for Infectious Disease Response and Prevention in Aviation within the FAA.","pending_committee_id":2549,"committee":{"committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
