Specifically, the President must establish a plan to (1) negotiate access for U.S. news and media organizations and their employees globally, and (2) work to enhance reciprocity for news and media organizations operating in the United States. The President may impose visa-blocking sanctions on any foreign person who is responsible for the jailing, killing, or torture of journalists or media personnel or significant efforts to harass or restrict the activities, terminate the visas, or threaten the safety of journalists or media personnel. Identification statements required to be placed on informational materials distributed in the United States by an agent of a foreign principal on behalf of such principal must be labeled, marked, or stamped conspicuously at the top of the first page of such materials. The annual country reports on human rights and development assistance and human rights and security assistance must include an assessment of freedom of expression with respect to electronic information in foreign countries. Lastly, the bill establishes the Global Press Freedom Defense Fund to provide assistance to foreign journalists and media personnel who are victims of restrictions on the internationally recognized right to freedom of expression, including assistance to pay for legal and other related expenses.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-21","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9441,"person_hash":"m9ujezsn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Benjamin Cardin","first_name":"Benjamin","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Cardin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":8046162,"votesmart_id":26888,"opensecrets_id":"N00001955","knowwho_pid":158887,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Cardin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7001","sast_bill_id":1367054}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13424,"subject_name":"International law and treaties"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":20569,"subject_name":"Military assistance, sales, and agreements"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13890,"subject_name":"Political movements and philosophies"},{"subject_id":13980,"subject_name":"Protest and dissent"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13868,"subject_name":"Rule of law and government transparency"},{"subject_id":13611,"subject_name":"Sanctions"},{"subject_id":13694,"subject_name":"Trade agreements and negotiations"},{"subject_id":13343,"subject_name":"Violent crime"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2196262,"date":"2020-06-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3818\/id\/2196262","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3818\/BILLS-116s3818is.pdf","text_size":333752,"text_hash":"5cf08a5e64d92e13d7c40c805e1b93fb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
