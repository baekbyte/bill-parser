Under current law, a state Medicaid program must cover former foster youth until the age of 26 if the youth were in the state's foster care system at the age of 18 and were enrolled in the state's Medicaid program while in foster care; a state may choose to also cover former foster youth from other states. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act altered these provisions to require a state Medicaid program to cover former foster youth from other states until the age of 26; such changes apply to former foster youth who reach the age of 18 on or after January 1, 2023. The bill requires state Medicaid programs to also cover former foster youth who were placed in a legal guardianship with a kinship caregiver or were emancipated from foster care before the age of 18. The bill also repeals the provision that requires former foster youth to have been enrolled in a state Medicaid program while in foster care in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage until the age of 26. States must also establish Medicaid outreach and enrollment programs for former foster youth.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-03","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3059","sast_bill_id":1266314},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8200","sast_bill_id":1377831}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2035700,"date":"2019-06-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1698\/id\/2035700","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1698\/BILLS-116s1698is.pdf","text_size":363063,"text_hash":"0af536e816c9df4eab5af7e9b65058d3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
