Specifically, it requires a state or Indian tribe that receives funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to report on use-of-force incidents involving a law enforcement officer and a civilian. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may reduce by up to 10% the JAG allocation of a state or Indian tribe that fails to comply. The bill also authorizes DOJ to make grants to law enforcement agencies to comply with the use-of-force reporting requirements, as well as to promote public awareness and train law enforcement personnel with respect to use-of-force incidents.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-04","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Introduced
