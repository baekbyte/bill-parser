Under current law, the FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness, as well as quality of design and manufacture, of laboratory-developed tests, while the CMS regulates clinical laboratories and testing processes. Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not enforced certain statutory and regulatory requirements with respect to these tests. The CMS must hold a public meeting to solicit recommendations to update existing regulations related to clinical laboratories, and the Department of Health and Human Services must report specified information to Congress, including an assessment of the availability and use of laboratory-developed testing procedures during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) response.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-17","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15313,"person_hash":"kkwugc78","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ted Cruz","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cruz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":210204,"votesmart_id":135705,"opensecrets_id":"N00033085","knowwho_pid":378522,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Cruz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":20850,"subject_name":"Chemical and biological weapons"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13529,"subject_name":"Nuclear weapons"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13431,"subject_name":"Terrorism"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177441,"date":"2020-04-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3512\/id\/2177441","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3512\/BILLS-116s3512is.pdf","text_size":320042,"text_hash":"eaa3ef5d8358da7d105ee3e7c584ae56"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
