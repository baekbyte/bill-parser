Specifically, the bill transfers maintenance of the database of veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses to the SBA. For the purposes of procurement programs for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, the SBA must certify the status of such businesses, require their periodic recertification, and penalize any small business that misrepresents its status. Accordingly, the bill also abolishes the Center for Verification and Evaluation of the VA and transfers all of its functions to the SBA.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-10","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21467,"person_hash":"b5vz9rek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kelly Loeffler","first_name":"Kelly","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loeffler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":6803079,"votesmart_id":188718,"opensecrets_id":"N00046125","knowwho_pid":724457,"ballotpedia":"Kelly_Loeffler","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9255,"person_hash":"8t4a6t34","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bill Cassidy","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cassidy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":6673315,"votesmart_id":69494,"opensecrets_id":"N00030245","knowwho_pid":266763,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Cassidy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9210,"person_hash":"jdd9osw6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Boozman","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Boozman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-3","ftm_eid":9687692,"votesmart_id":27958,"opensecrets_id":"N00013873","knowwho_pid":209930,"ballotpedia":"John_Boozman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16521,"person_hash":"0gww5x7w","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Rounds","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rounds","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SD","ftm_eid":6580808,"votesmart_id":7455,"opensecrets_id":"N00035187","knowwho_pid":198882,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Rounds","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1615","sast_bill_id":1234646}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207334,"date":"2020-09-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4520\/id\/2207334","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4520\/BILLS-116s4520is.pdf","text_size":330947,"text_hash":"a064d5551dcfc87550b7abd14411fd5c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
