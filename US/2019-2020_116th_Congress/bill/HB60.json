It moves administration of the program from the Department of Labor to the Department of Agriculture, and eliminates the requirement that employers hire any qualified U.S. applicants until 50% of the time period of the H-2A worker's contract has elapsed. The bill also revises requirements for employer-provided housing or housing allowances for H-2A workers, including standards for such accommodations. The employer shall request an inspection of the housing to certify that it meets the required standards. Aliens admittted as H2-A workers who overstay their visas are barred from the program for five years. Aliens admitted on the basis of fraud or who commit certain crimes are barred permanently. Employers who knowingly hire H-2A workers who overstay their visas or employers who engage in fraud or misrepresentation shall be barred from the program.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16447,"person_hash":"gvpp7oqw","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rick Allen","first_name":"Rick","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Allen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-12","ftm_eid":6939101,"votesmart_id":136062,"opensecrets_id":"N00032240","knowwho_pid":378450,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Allen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14909,"person_hash":"yggb6yb5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Rice","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-7","ftm_eid":17658351,"votesmart_id":11763,"opensecrets_id":"N00033832","knowwho_pid":392043,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Rice_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13191,"subject_name":"Foreign labor"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"},{"subject_id":13552,"subject_name":"Livestock"},{"subject_id":13899,"subject_name":"Migrant, seasonal, agricultural labor"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1845504,"date":"2019-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB60\/id\/1845504","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr60\/BILLS-116hr60ih.pdf","text_size":140399,"text_hash":"b689e07c86abf3f3f9d10aa7041d10cc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
