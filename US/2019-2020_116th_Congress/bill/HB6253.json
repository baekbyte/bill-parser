The bill provides appropriations for the purpose of awarding a prize to the creator of a vaccine that (1) reduces the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 by more than 50%, and (2) is affordable and widely available to the public. Additionally, an issuer of securities that is developing a coronavirus vaccine, researching or producing medical equipment related to COVID-19, or researching or producing technology related to preventing the spread of COVID-19 may qualify for an exemption from SEC registration requirements regardless of the size of the issuer's offers or sales. Furthermore, these issuers are not subject to joint and several liability for certain claims. The provisions set forth in this bill expire the earlier of (1) the date the prize is awarded, or (2) three years after enactment.
