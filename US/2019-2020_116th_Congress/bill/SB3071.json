The bill grants leave to private sector and federal employees to care for a domestic partner and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with such employees is the equivalent of a family relationship if (1) such individual has a serious health condition, or (2) there is a qualifying exigency due to such employees' active duty in the Armed Forces. The bill entitles an employee who is a domestic partner, next of kin of a member of the Armed Forces, or any individual related by blood or affinity to a service member whose close association is the equivalent of a family relationship to take leave to care for the service member.
