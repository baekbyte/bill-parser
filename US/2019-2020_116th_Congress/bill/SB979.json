Advance contracts are established prior to disasters to provide life-sustaining goods and services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The report must include (1) information required in the initial report on recurring disaster response requirements; and (2) an updated strategy that defines the objectives of advance contracts, how such contracts contribute to FEMA disaster response operations, how to maximize the award of advance contracts to small business concerns, and whether and how such contracts should be prioritized in relation to new post-disaster contract awards. The bill sets forth additional duties of FEMA with respect to advance contracts, including requiring FEMA to (1) update and implement guidance for its program office and acquisition personnel to identify acquisition planning time frames and considerations across the entire acquisition planning process, and (2) communicate the purpose and use of a master acquisition planning schedule.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-02","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},{"date":"2019-11-08","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-11-12","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
