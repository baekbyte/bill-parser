Specifically, the CMS must establish a demonstration program to test the impact of waiving the institutions for mental diseases (IMDs) Medicaid payment exclusion on specified metrics relating to inpatient psychiatric hospital services and substance abuse services. (Current law generally prohibits federal payment under Medicaid for services provided in IMDs for individuals under the age of 65, although states may receive payment through certain mechanisms like Medicaid demonstration waivers.) The CMS must also establish a pilot program to test the impact of eliminating the Medicare 190-day lifetime limit for inpatient psychiatric hospital services, particularly the impact on value, choice, and the alignment of inpatient mental health benefits with inpatient physical health care benefits under Medicare.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-31","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11058,"person_hash":"aw6szgk2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Huizenga","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Huizenga","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-2","ftm_eid":6574786,"votesmart_id":38351,"opensecrets_id":"N00030673","knowwho_pid":288017,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Huizenga","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9167,"person_hash":"aaq2jux5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Tonko","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Tonko","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":4469600,"votesmart_id":4403,"opensecrets_id":"N00030196","knowwho_pid":197757,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Tonko","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13240,"subject_name":"Medical education"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206437,"date":"2020-08-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7912\/id\/2206437","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7912\/BILLS-116hr7912ih.pdf","text_size":323849,"text_hash":"eaaf72cc80ef32e43d7143cfd6161224"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
