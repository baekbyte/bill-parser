Specifically, the bill exempts individuals with a known traveler number (assigned to an individual and accepted as validating that the individual holding such identifier is a member of a known low-risk population) from REAL ID requirements; requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to accept enrollment in PreCheck as an allowable alternative to presenting a REAL ID compliant credential to board a commercial aircraft until April 1, 2022; directs the TSA to develop, socialize, and implement alternative checkpoint screening procedures for individuals arriving at a checkpoint without a form of acceptable identification; provides an opportunity for airports to request the TSA to conduct REAL ID implementation exercises; and allows states to establish a process for the submission of electronic documents and electronic facial images when individuals are applying for a REAL ID compliant identification.","pending_committee_id":4016,"committee":{"committee_id":4016,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime
