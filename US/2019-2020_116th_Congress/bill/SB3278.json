Currently, the declaration of a disaster by the SBA is contingent upon a certain number of homes or businesses being damaged or economically injured (e.g., at least 25 homes or 25 businesses are damaged). The bill authorizes the SBA to declare a disaster in a rural area if any home, small business, private nonprofit, or small agricultural cooperative located in such area has incurred significant damage. The bill defines a rural area as an area with a population of less than 200,000 outside an urbanized area.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-12","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9496,"person_hash":"gcopvn6m","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Risch","first_name":"James","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Risch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":6576171,"votesmart_id":2919,"opensecrets_id":"N00029441","knowwho_pid":213702,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Risch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9422,"person_hash":"cleoh36j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeanne Shaheen","first_name":"Jeanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shaheen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":2227644,"votesmart_id":1663,"opensecrets_id":"N00024790","knowwho_pid":209675,"ballotpedia":"Jeanne_Shaheen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2141017,"date":"2020-02-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3278\/id\/2141017","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3278\/BILLS-116s3278is.pdf","text_size":322686,"text_hash":"d11d4fbe005937d85972c70f73d767dc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
