Commerce must prepare and consider a plan if the council fails to submit the modifications or amendments. The Government Accountability Office must assess and report on whether the subsequent implementation of the approved plan or amendment complies with national standards.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-27","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
