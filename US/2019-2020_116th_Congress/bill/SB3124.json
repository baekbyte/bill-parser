The bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop standards for cruise ship owners to provide passengers with a conspicuous and unambiguous summary of key terms of passage contracts before they are binding. Vessel owners must provide each passenger with a summary meeting those standards and include the summary in promotional literature. The bill prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations. DOT must (1) establish a hotline for passenger complaints, (2) determine whether any of the enumerated rights in the international cruise line passenger bill of rights (adopted by the members of the Cruise Lines International Association) are enforceable under federal law, and (3) establish an advisory committee for passenger vessel consumer protection. Vessel owners must ensure that a vessel is staffed with sea marshals and medical staff. DOT must designate a director of victim support services, establish a 24-hour telephone number for crime victims, develop a written summary of rights for crime victims, maintain a statistical compilation of reported incidents, and study the feasibility of having an individual on board each vessel to provide victim support and related services. The Department of Homeland Security may withhold or revoke the clearance of, and the Coast Guard may deny entry into the United States to, any vessel owner who commits an act or omission for which a penalty is imposed under this bill or fails to pay the penalty.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-19","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13651,"subject_name":"Accidents"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13781,"subject_name":"Assault and harassment offenses"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13813,"subject_name":"Coast guard"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13594,"subject_name":"Contracts and agency"},{"subject_id":13429,"subject_name":"Crime prevention"},{"subject_id":13406,"subject_name":"Crime victims"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13185,"subject_name":"Federal preemption"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13360,"subject_name":"Marine and inland water transportation"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13664,"subject_name":"Photography and imaging"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"},{"subject_id":13728,"subject_name":"Sexually transmitted diseases"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"},{"subject_id":13644,"subject_name":"Transportation costs"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13533,"subject_name":"Travel and tourism"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2087390,"date":"2020-01-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3124\/id\/2087390","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3124\/BILLS-116s3124is.pdf","text_size":397403,"text_hash":"8ac31d78b4b0676314f96bf247160100"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
