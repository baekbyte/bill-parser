Currently, the Department of Labor issued guidance on April 27, 2020 (UIPL 18-20), requiring states to collect 100% of such payments up front and then reimburse them by 50% later. In addition, the bill allows states to opt to issue such reimbursements or to reduce the amounts required to be paid for weeks of employment after March 12, 2020, and before enactment of this bill.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-02","action":"Introduced in the Senate, read twice, considered, read the third time, and passed without amendment by Unanimous Consent.
