As part of the strategy to prevent the resurgence of ISIS, the bill requires the State Department to report on (1) the Turkish incursion into Syria; (2) Turkey's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; (3) the estimated net worth of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan; and (4) foreign persons determined to have knowingly provided defense articles, services, or technology to Turkey that could be used in its operations in Syria. Further, the State Department must brief Congress on Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, U.S. activities to counter such influence, and the ability of ISIS to reconstitute. The President must oppose loans to Turkey from international finance institutions and impose sanctions against identified foreign persons that provided Turkey with defense articles, services, or technology for its operations in Syria. The bill also authorizes the President to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria, and it requires the State Department to give priority designation to certain Syrian Kurds as refugees of special humanitarian concern. Additionally, the bill prohibits the sale of arms to Turkey for its operations in Syria, and it imposes sanctions against persons providing arms to Turkish forces in Syria. It also imposes sanctions against senior Turkish government officials, financial institutions that facilitate transactions for Turkish Armed Forces, and Russian persons supporting the Assad regime.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-17","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Committee on Foreign Relations.
