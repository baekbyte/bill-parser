In any year, not more than a daily average of 900 veterans placed in a medical foster home may have their care covered.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-05","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1527","sast_bill_id":1230988}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13382,"subject_name":"Veterans' loans, housing, homeless programs"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2170200,"date":"2020-03-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3408\/id\/2170200","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3408\/BILLS-116s3408is.pdf","text_size":317736,"text_hash":"782c918479884ad1bcf810c81fa87fc1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
