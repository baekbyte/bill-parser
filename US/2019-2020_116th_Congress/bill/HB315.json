A state with an approved reclamation program may enter into a memorandum of understanding with relevant federal or state agencies for remediating mine drainage on abandoned mine land and water impacted by abandoned mines. In addition, the bill authorizes a partnership between a state and a community reclaimer for remediating abandoned mine land if the partnership's proposed project is consistent with an approved state memorandum of understanding and conducted on certain prioritized sites; the state assumes all responsibly on behalf of the community reclaimer and the owner of the proposed project site for costs or damages resulting from actions or inactions of the community reclaimer in carrying out the project, except for gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the community reclaimer; and the state has necessary legal authority to conduct the project and has financial resources to ensure the project's completion. A community reclaimer is a person who (1) voluntarily assists a state in a reclamation project, (2) did not participate in the creation of site conditions at the proposed site or activities that caused any land or waters to become eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures, (3) is not a past or current owner or operator of any site with ongoing reclamation obligations, and (4) is not subject to outstanding violations of surface coal mining permits.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-08","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Unanimous Consent.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Reported by the Committee on Natural Resources.
