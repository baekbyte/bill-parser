Specifically, the bill directs the NHTSA to issue regulations that require motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States to protect against unauthorized access to electronic controls, critical software systems, or driving data; the NHTSA to require the fuel economy labeling that manufacturers attach to motor vehicles to display a cyber dashboard with a standardized graphic to inform consumers about the extent to which the vehicle protects individuals' cybersecurity and privacy beyond the minimum requirements; and the Federal Trade Commission to require manufacturers to notify owners or lessees about the collection, retention and use of driving data and provide an option to terminate such data collection and retention, and to prohibit manufacturers from using such data for advertising or marketing without the owner's or lessee's consent. The Federal Highway Administration must (1) develop a tool to assist transportation authorities in identifying, detecting, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents; and (2) designate a cyber coordinator to monitor, alert, and advise transportation officials of cyber incidents.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-18","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13247,"subject_name":"Motor fuels"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047579,"date":"2019-07-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2182\/id\/2047579","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2182\/BILLS-116s2182is.pdf","text_size":260976,"text_hash":"4d381bf913e5acef6d13c3d460af2365"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
