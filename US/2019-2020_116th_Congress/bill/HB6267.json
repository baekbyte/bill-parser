Specifically, the bill prohibits a state from reintroducing the gray wolf unless Interior approves a state petition that meets the requirements of this bill. If an affected county makes a recommendation to deny the petition, then Interior may not approve the petition. A person in a state with an approved petition may take a gray wolf that is attacking a stock animal or dog if the person (1) is not trespassing or on land administered by the National Park Service; and (2) did not intentionally bait, feed, or otherwise attract the wolf.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2020-03-30","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-30","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11144,"person_hash":"ojklk0v4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Tipton","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tipton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-3","ftm_eid":6022986,"votesmart_id":65403,"opensecrets_id":"N00027509","knowwho_pid":267906,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Tipton","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13481,"subject_name":"Animals"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13482,"subject_name":"Animal protection and human-animal relationships"},{"subject_id":13543,"subject_name":"Endangered and threatened species"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13554,"subject_name":"Mammals"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175984,"date":"2020-03-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6267\/id\/2175984","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6267\/BILLS-116hr6267ih.pdf","text_size":342309,"text_hash":"aa1af9d375c33827f109aee07b936e39"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
