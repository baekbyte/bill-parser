The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal, receipts derived from borrowing, receipts or outlays of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and outlays relating to a natural disaster if the law providing the funds explicitly exempts the funds from the requirement and is agreed to by a majority of each chamber of Congress. The amendment requires the President to annually submit to Congress a budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts. The amendment specifies exceptions to the requirements if a declaration of war is in effect, the United States is engaged in military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security, economic growth is less than 0%, or the unemployment rate is more than 7%. The amendment prohibits a court from enforcing the requirements by ordering cuts to Social Security or Medicare payments unless the funds available to the trust fund for a program are not sufficient to cover the outlays that would occur during the year if the fund were fully solvent.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-04","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9471,"person_hash":"61xtznm6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jon Tester","first_name":"Jon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7974707,"votesmart_id":20928,"opensecrets_id":"N00027605","knowwho_pid":196276,"ballotpedia":"Jon_Tester","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9625,"person_hash":"7pac6cxl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joe Manchin","first_name":"Joe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Manchin","suffix":"III","nickname":"","district":"SD-WV","ftm_eid":7573477,"votesmart_id":7547,"opensecrets_id":"N00032838","knowwho_pid":219013,"ballotpedia":"Joe_Manchin_III","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR11","sast_bill_id":1137448},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR22","sast_bill_id":1141992},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR55","sast_bill_id":1250757}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13442,"subject_name":"Natural disasters"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1985837,"date":"2019-04-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SJR18\/id\/1985837","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/sjres18\/BILLS-116sjres18is.pdf","text_size":278531,"text_hash":"cef8107da6ba48e4b04e57729c4930c3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
