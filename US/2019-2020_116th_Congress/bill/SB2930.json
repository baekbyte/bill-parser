The bill exempts certain water transfers between public water supplies in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana from prohibitions on illegal trade of plants and wildlife. Specifically, the prohibitions do not apply to covered water transfers containing prohibited species if the species are present in both public water supplies before the transfer, the water is subject to effective mitigation measures, and the water is transferred directly between the supplies; or the water is transferred in a closed conveyance system, such as a pipe system, and sent directly to treatment facilities where the species will be destroyed. The costs of the mitigation measures must be borne by the entity that sells the water for financial gain. Finally, the bill establishes notification requirements for water transfers.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-21","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15313,"person_hash":"kkwugc78","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ted Cruz","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cruz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":210204,"votesmart_id":135705,"opensecrets_id":"N00033085","knowwho_pid":378522,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Cruz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9444,"person_hash":"0ie58qto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cornyn","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cornyn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":6646197,"votesmart_id":15375,"opensecrets_id":"N00024852","knowwho_pid":211675,"ballotpedia":"John_Cornyn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9483,"person_hash":"sjcjzxst","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Barrasso","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barrasso","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WY","ftm_eid":10154698,"votesmart_id":52662,"opensecrets_id":"N00006236","knowwho_pid":214311,"ballotpedia":"John_Barrasso","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9255,"person_hash":"8t4a6t34","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bill Cassidy","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cassidy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":6673315,"votesmart_id":69494,"opensecrets_id":"N00030245","knowwho_pid":266763,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Cassidy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB29","sast_bill_id":1137335}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13331,"subject_name":"Aquatic ecology"},{"subject_id":13537,"subject_name":"Arkansas"},{"subject_id":13483,"subject_name":"Crimes against animals and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13440,"subject_name":"Louisiana"},{"subject_id":13573,"subject_name":"Texas"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2071687,"date":"2019-12-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2930\/id\/2071687","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2930\/BILLS-116s2930is.pdf","text_size":329386,"text_hash":"0e950f943980299447eace55eccf1bec"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
