A \"forked convertible virtual currency\" is any convertible virtual currency to which the taxpayer becomes entitled by reason of a hard fork. A \"hard fork\" is any material change in the shared digital ledger which is used to verify by consensus transactions in the currency if the change results in the maintenance of independent shared digital ledgers with respect to the currency. The legislation, regulations, or guidance must prescribe the tax treatment of receiving forked convertible virtual currency, rules for calculating and allocating the basis of forked convertible virtual currency, rules for calculating the fair market value of forked convertible virtual currency at any given time, and rules for determining the holding period of forked convertible virtual currency.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-09","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16458,"person_hash":"3z9mh67s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Emmer","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Emmer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-6","ftm_eid":12996955,"votesmart_id":38894,"opensecrets_id":"N00035440","knowwho_pid":227769,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Emmer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13654,"subject_name":"Currency"},{"subject_id":13368,"subject_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2046684,"date":"2019-07-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3650\/id\/2046684","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3650\/BILLS-116hr3650ih.pdf","text_size":365734,"text_hash":"ddc02aba9f00e22d2c5a613cd71c0649"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
