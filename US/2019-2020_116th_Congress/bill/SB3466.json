Specifically, the bill eliminates cost-sharing for beneficiaries whose coverage under private health insurance, a federal program (other than Medicare), a Medicare supplemental policy, or Medicare Advantage does not already do so. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must establish a process for determining a beneficiary's eligibility and notifying Medicare Advantage organizations of such determinations. The bill's provisions apply to products that are furnished during the five-year period beginning on January 1, 2021, or the date on which the product is first marketed, whichever is later.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19529,"person_hash":"ygy5eihl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Doug Jones","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Jones","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AL","ftm_eid":15183709,"votesmart_id":176464,"opensecrets_id":"N00024817","knowwho_pid":625255,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Jones_(Alabama)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4597","sast_bill_id":1275991}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175852,"date":"2020-03-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3466\/id\/2175852","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3466\/BILLS-116s3466is.pdf","text_size":320179,"text_hash":"20bf2c3d8cab71425d96836b73df27a5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
