DOE must carry out, within the Office of Electricity, a program for the research of energy storage systems (systems or strategies that improve the ability to shift the dispatch of energy in time, across multiple timescales). DOE must carry out a loan program for (1) the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in a specific project, and (2) programs that finance the demonstration and deployment of multiple energy storage systems through a financial assistance program. Loans may only be used to fund projects and programs relating to the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities. DOE must carry out a technical assistance and grant program for (1) disseminating information and providing technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems; and (2) making grants to those entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems.","pending_committee_id":2933,"committee":{"committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-13","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-14","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15239,"person_hash":"2abxxyrw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Takano","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Takano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-41","ftm_eid":17657771,"votesmart_id":22337,"opensecrets_id":"N00006701","knowwho_pid":378804,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Takano","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14135,"person_hash":"5nf6fekr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chris Collins","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-27","ftm_eid":4978019,"votesmart_id":139770,"opensecrets_id":"N00001285","knowwho_pid":413516,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Collins_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20105,"person_hash":"pj9a15df","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abigail Spanberger","first_name":"Abigail","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spanberger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-7","ftm_eid":44045205,"votesmart_id":179682,"opensecrets_id":"N00041418","knowwho_pid":630216,"ballotpedia":"Abigail_Spanberger","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9051,"person_hash":"x4hkzhov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Grijalva","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Grijalva","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-3","ftm_eid":17657668,"votesmart_id":28253,"opensecrets_id":"N00025284","knowwho_pid":211719,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Grijalva","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1593","sast_bill_id":1264043}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13332,"subject_name":"Atmospheric science and weather"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1978662,"date":"2019-03-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1743\/id\/1978662","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1743\/BILLS-116hr1743ih.pdf","text_size":293833,"text_hash":"b4ba74e590babe8c183800ad38db75e5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
