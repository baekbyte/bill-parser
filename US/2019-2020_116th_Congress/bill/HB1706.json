The restrictions do not apply to assistance for (1) certain projects administered by local organizations, (2) projects to meet basic human needs such as drought relief, and (3) activities related to Syrian compliance with certain weapons treaties. The restrictions apply through FY2024 and shall be lifted if the President certifies to Congress that various criteria have been met, such as that the Syrian government (1) is no longer using Syrian airspace to target civilian populations, (2) is no longer cutting off international aid to besieged areas, and (3) is releasing all political prisoners. The Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development shall report to Congress on the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Syria. The report shall address (1) the challenges in accessing areas controlled by the Syrian government, (2) the roles of U.S. allies and partners in ensuring access to various areas, and (3) how assistance is being monitored and evaluated.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign
