It also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to states, other jurisdictions, and certain nonprofits for activities and research related to preventive care services. Specifically, the CDC must award competitive grants to carry out a national campaign to increase awareness of, and disseminate information about, preventive care services. In carrying out the campaign, the CDC must consult with relevant public health and health care experts. The campaign must focus particularly on medically underserved communities, communities of color, and communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It must address, among other topics, misinformation about seeking preventive care during the COVID-19 emergency and the safety of health care facilities.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2208608,"date":"2020-09-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4507\/id\/2208608","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4507\/BILLS-116s4507is.pdf","text_size":307010,"text_hash":"392abb3c2f8753370995ee7a93619d5a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
