The departments must use the definition of short-term, limited-duration insurance in use immediately prior to publication of the rule. (The rule requires the duration of short-term, limited-duration insurance to be less than three months, including renewals. Previously, such insurance was required to expire less than 12 months after its effective date.) Short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans are plans that may only offer coverage for a limited amount of time under law and that are exempt from the market requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (e.g., coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions). On August 3, 2018, the departments issued a revised rule that increases the maximum authorized duration of such plans from less than 3 months (including renewals) to an initial maximum duration of less than 12 months (with a total duration of up to 36 months, including renewals). The rule took effect October 2, 2018.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-10","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-01","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9215,"person_hash":"g4kbm7rs","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Fortenberry","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fortenberry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NE-1","ftm_eid":17658605,"votesmart_id":41929,"opensecrets_id":"N00026631","knowwho_pid":226527,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Fortenberry","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13368,"subject_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1882324,"date":"2019-01-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB458\/id\/1882324","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr458\/BILLS-116hr458ih.pdf","text_size":123193,"text_hash":"ffb7beb4abf2c2ebebb47084319e1434"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
