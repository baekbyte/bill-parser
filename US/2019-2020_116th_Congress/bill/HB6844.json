However, this exemption does not apply if the employer violates state or federal workplace safety law. Additionally, employees may still be eligible for unemployment benefits if the employee terminates their employment due to their employer failing to address their health concerns.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-12","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9333,"person_hash":"ftinbgg3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Turner","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Turner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-10","ftm_eid":17658265,"votesmart_id":45519,"opensecrets_id":"N00025175","knowwho_pid":211690,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Turner_(Ohio)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13551,"subject_name":"Labor-management relations"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2190666,"date":"2020-06-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6844\/id\/2190666","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6844\/BILLS-116hr6844ih.pdf","text_size":310535,"text_hash":"11fa6e87ba5c140138176db1d6ec3ec4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
