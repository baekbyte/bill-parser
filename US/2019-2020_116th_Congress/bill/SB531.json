Under current law, federal first responders are subject to a mandatory retirement age of 57. To facilitate this earlier retirement, federal first responders are required to pay a greater percentage of their salary towards retirement. Additionally, their annuity amount is calculated at a higher rate than other federal employees. allows a federal first responder to remain in the accelerated retirement system if they are placed in another civil service position outside of that system after returning to work from a work-related injury or illness. Further, if such an employee is separated from service before they are entitled to receive an annuity, they may receive a refund of their accelerated contributions.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9471,"person_hash":"61xtznm6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jon Tester","first_name":"Jon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7974707,"votesmart_id":20928,"opensecrets_id":"N00027605","knowwho_pid":196276,"ballotpedia":"Jon_Tester","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9459,"person_hash":"f0qn5jvf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Collins","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":10045641,"votesmart_id":379,"opensecrets_id":"N00000491","knowwho_pid":165234,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Collins_(Maine)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1256","sast_bill_id":1205667}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13696,"subject_name":"Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)"},{"subject_id":13585,"subject_name":"Congressional officers and employees"},{"subject_id":20695,"subject_name":"Customs enforcement"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13725,"subject_name":"Supreme Court"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1944435,"date":"2019-03-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB531\/id\/1944435","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s531\/BILLS-116s531is.pdf","text_size":298065,"text_hash":"22cc8f390153b8b2ce10e352c71be85e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
