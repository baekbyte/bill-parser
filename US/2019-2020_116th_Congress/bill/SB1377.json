Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to state and local governments, tribal organizations, and public defender offices for public defense. A grant recipient must use the grant to establish a data collection process, develop workload limits, and satisfy specified compensation requirements (e.g., pay parity between public defenders and prosecutors). The bill also directs DOJ to award grants to nonprofits and government organizations to train public defenders, court-appointed attorneys, and contract attorneys. Additionally, a state that receives Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program funds must annually submit to DOJ information related to the legal representation of defendants in criminal cases. It also reauthorizes through FY2022 the student loan repayment program for prosecutors and public defenders and otherwise revises the program, including by increasing the maximum benefit amount.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-08","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-08","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2868","sast_bill_id":1263631}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2025808,"date":"2019-05-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1377\/id\/2025808","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1377\/BILLS-116s1377is.pdf","text_size":238983,"text_hash":"4f6c2ee6c0b7877771a74f616bc10bee"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
