It requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a policy under which a certified lead-based paint inspector or risk assessor may access a military installation in order to conduct lead testing. Penalties are imposed for failure to provide testing results to relevant government agencies or obstruction of the testing. DOD shall test for, and mitigate, the presence of lead-based paint and lead in drinking water in schools that are (1) owned or operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity, or (2) providing educational programs pursuant to agreements to provide education to military dependents. DOD may not discourage inspection of housing for presence of lead-based paint or sources of lead. The bill expands requirements for lead-level testing or screening as part of well-baby care under the TRICARE program. It prescribes testing for the level of lead in the blood at the ages of both 12 and 24 months for children at elevated risk of lead exposure. The Government Accountability Office shall study the effectiveness of such screening, testing, and treatment for lead exposure and poisoning. DOD shall maintain records concerning the year housing for military personnel was built, and members must provide notice of when their residence was built as a condition of receiving a housing allowance. The military departments shall certify whether housing complies with requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding lead-based paint hazards at federal facilities. Political appointees in military departments that have failed to meet the certification requirements may not receive bonus pay.","pending_committee_id":2320,"committee":{"committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-11","committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2500","sast_bill_id":1256454},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2252","sast_bill_id":1251226},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2254","sast_bill_id":1251168},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2255","sast_bill_id":1251159},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2257","sast_bill_id":1251171},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1790","sast_bill_id":1267965}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13604,"subject_name":"Blood and blood diseases"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13153,"subject_name":"Department of Defense"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":81065,"subject_name":"Employee performance"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13244,"subject_name":"Military facilities and property"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2003731,"date":"2019-04-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1143\/id\/2003731","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1143\/BILLS-116s1143is.pdf","text_size":318571,"text_hash":"99dee3687edecd60abbaf5b911ac7295"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
