Specifically, a hospital must (1) notify HHS before closing most or all of its units or departments or specific units or departments where the closure may significantly impact the health and welfare of a community (e.g., emergency departments or labor and delivery units), and (2) provide a closure plan that addresses specified issues related to continuity of patient care and the health and safety needs of the community served by the departments or units. HHS may reject, approve, or require modification of the plan. The bill provides for certain judicial remedies in the event of closures that occur without an approved plan or in violation of an approved plan.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-27","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16487,"person_hash":"v3itu924","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brendan Boyle","first_name":"Brendan","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Boyle","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-13","ftm_eid":13006066,"votesmart_id":47357,"opensecrets_id":"N00035307","knowwho_pid":269627,"ballotpedia":"Brendan_Boyle","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":20692,"subject_name":"Chemistry"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13606,"subject_name":"Judicial procedure and administration"},{"subject_id":13551,"subject_name":"Labor-management relations"},{"subject_id":13240,"subject_name":"Medical education"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2113854,"date":"2020-01-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5681\/id\/2113854","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5681\/BILLS-116hr5681ih.pdf","text_size":329140,"text_hash":"f89779fe2c5af6b94bb5b903f4771237"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
