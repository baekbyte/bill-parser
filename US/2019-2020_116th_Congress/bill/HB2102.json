Family members of veterans and reservists who resided at these military installations are also eligible for hospital care and medical services under this bill. The bill also provides a presumption of service connection for veterans and reservists who were exposed to such substances. Under a presumption of service connection, specific conditions diagnosed in veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service.
