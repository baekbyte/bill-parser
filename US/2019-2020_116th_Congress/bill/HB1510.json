Specifically, states may use the funds to (1) lower the cost for individuals to purchase coverage, (2) lower out-of-pocket costs for individuals with insurance, (3) pay health care providers, (4) cover or provide additional specified services, and (5) otherwise increase coverage options and stabilize premiums in the state's insurance market. If a state does not apply for funds under the program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in consultation with the state, must use the funds to stabilize premiums by partially reimbursing insurers for claims in a specified cost range. The bill also revises the grace period that health insurers must provide to recipients of premium subsidies before discontinuing health coverage for nonpayment of premiums. The grace period is shortened from 3 months to 30 days unless state law includes an applicable grace period.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9176,"person_hash":"cu7fgqvh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Burgess","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Burgess","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-26","ftm_eid":17658442,"votesmart_id":50120,"opensecrets_id":"N00025219","knowwho_pid":211708,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Burgess","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20049,"person_hash":"v02baz57","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dan Crenshaw","first_name":"Dan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crenshaw","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-2","ftm_eid":44449939,"votesmart_id":177270,"opensecrets_id":"N00042224","knowwho_pid":644108,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Crenshaw","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2469","sast_bill_id":1256511}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13306,"subject_name":"Dental care"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13608,"subject_name":"Hearing, speech, and vision care"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1967904,"date":"2019-03-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1510\/id\/1967904","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1510\/BILLS-116hr1510ih.pdf","text_size":167804,"text_hash":"64cb432663628159d0daf5b1a58a8bc9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
