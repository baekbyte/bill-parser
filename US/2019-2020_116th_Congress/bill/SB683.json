Under the program, the Department of Transportation must issue vouchers of $3,500 to offset the purchase or lease price of a new automobile made in the United States if at least 45% of the automobile's parts come from the United States or Canada and assembly of the automobile occurs in the United States. The amount of the voucher for new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles is $4,500.
