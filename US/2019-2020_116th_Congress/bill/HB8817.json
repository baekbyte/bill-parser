This increase encourages corporate donors (e.g., restaurants and retailers) to donate excess inventory rather than destroying it. The bill allows a carryover of excess inventory into the succeeding taxable year. The bill also directs the Department of the Treasury to revise regulations with respect to the treatment of inventory as costs of goods sold for purposes of the charitable tax deduction.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-11-24","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-11-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-11-24","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18326,"person_hash":"j8jlv1qm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jimmy Panetta","first_name":"Jimmy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Panetta","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-20","ftm_eid":35018515,"votesmart_id":169078,"opensecrets_id":"N00038601","knowwho_pid":561057,"ballotpedia":"Jimmy_Panetta","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9324,"person_hash":"88p7q4un","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adrian Smith","first_name":"Adrian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NE-3","ftm_eid":6558263,"votesmart_id":21284,"opensecrets_id":"N00027623","knowwho_pid":196871,"ballotpedia":"Adrian_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":81061,"subject_name":"Charitable contributions"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2218079,"date":"2020-12-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8817\/id\/2218079","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8817\/BILLS-116hr8817ih.pdf","text_size":291764,"text_hash":"be5a14f555846c03ca23a9ee251c5dac"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
