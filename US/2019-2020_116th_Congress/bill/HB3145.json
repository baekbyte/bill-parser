Specifically, DOT must require manufacturers to install technology in each motor vehicle with a keyless ignition device and an internal combustion engine to automatically shut off the motor vehicle after the motor vehicle has idled for a period necessary to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning; and a keyless ignition device and automatic transmission to prevent movement (i.e., rollaway) of the motor vehicle if (1) the transmission of the motor vehicle is not in the park setting, (2) the motor vehicle does not exceed the speed determined by DOT, (3) the door for the operator of the motor vehicle is open, (4) the seat belt of the operator of the motor vehicle is unbuckled, and (5) the service brake of the motor vehicle is not engaged.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and
