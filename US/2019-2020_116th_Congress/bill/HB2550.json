Specifically, a grant under the Urban Area Security Initiative or the State Homeland Security Grant Program may be used to purchase or distribute anti-blood loss supplies (tourniquets, gauze, dressings, or other appropriate materials) for use in medical emergencies in places where people gather; to provide training on the proper use of anti-blood loss supplies to enhance public safety; or to make grants to an eligible entity for such purposes. DHS shall (1) allocate such funds by a formula developed by DHS that takes into consideration the relative populations of each geographic area for which a grant is made; and (2) conduct outreach to inform state, local, and tribal governments and high-risk urban areas that apply for grants under that initiative or program of the availability of funds under this bill.","pending_committee_id":3984,"committee":{"committee_id":3984,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-07","committee_id":2306,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Homeland Security"},{"date":"2019-05-28","committee_id":3984,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-07","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
