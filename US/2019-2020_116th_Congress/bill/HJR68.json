The prohibition excludes expenditures for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. For a national emergency, two-thirds of each chamber of Congress may authorize expenditures that exceed receipts for limited times. Debts incurred from the expenditures must be paid as soon as practicable. The amendment requires a two-thirds roll call vote of each chamber of Congress to increase the public debt limit. It also requires the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. If the President does not submit a balanced budget for a fiscal year, any executive actions may be unilaterally overturned by a simple majority vote of each of chamber of Congress until the President submits a balanced budget.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-20","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-06-28","committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-20","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-28","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20065,"person_hash":"ciu7yxo6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Green","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Green","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-7","ftm_eid":11030026,"votesmart_id":139030,"opensecrets_id":"N00041873","knowwho_pid":399479,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Green_(Tennessee)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13657,"subject_name":"Congressional-executive branch relations"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13590,"subject_name":"House of Representatives"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13793,"subject_name":"Senate"},{"subject_id":13465,"subject_name":"War and emergency powers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2042002,"date":"2019-06-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HJR68\/id\/2042002","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hjres68\/BILLS-116hjres68ih.pdf","text_size":364411,"text_hash":"c5bfc9707671388afd1d00231dcf1c02"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
