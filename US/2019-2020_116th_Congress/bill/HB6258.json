Specifically, the bill requires the product's sponsor to demonstrate, among other things, that their product has been approved in one of the specified countries, the FDA and listed countries have not withdrawn approval because of safety or effectiveness concerns, and there is a public health or unmet medical need for the product. The FDA may only decline approval if the FDA determines that the product is not safe or effective. The FDA must make such a determination not later than 30 days after receiving a request. Congress may pass a joint resolution to grant reciprocal marketing approval of a product that the FDA declines to approve through the reciprocal process.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20100,"person_hash":"cqzhn7pe","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chip Roy","first_name":"Chip","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-21","ftm_eid":44449969,"votesmart_id":177319,"opensecrets_id":"N00042268","knowwho_pid":223268,"ballotpedia":"Chip_Roy","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6260","sast_bill_id":1359697},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2161","sast_bill_id":1271681},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3545","sast_bill_id":1361346},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4537","sast_bill_id":1377505}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177161,"date":"2020-04-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6258\/id\/2177161","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6258\/BILLS-116hr6258ih.pdf","text_size":323586,"text_hash":"4b354030a919e4aee8f22d0993dccef9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
