Specifically, the bill prohibits a federal contractor from taking a personnel action against an employee who has lawfully disclosed information the employee reasonably believes shows (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (2) gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Further, a federal contractor may not take a personnel action against an employee because of the employee's (1) lawful exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right, or testifying or assisting in the exercise of such right; (2) cooperation with or disclosure of information to the agency's inspector general or special counsel; or (3) refusal to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law, rule, or regulation. A federal agency is prohibited from pressuring a federal contractor from taking any personnel action against an employee based on such disclosures or actions by the employee.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-06","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13499,"subject_name":"Due process and equal protection"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2069879,"date":"2019-11-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2798\/id\/2069879","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2798\/BILLS-116s2798is.pdf","text_size":331054,"text_hash":"9ff857eacfdfa5858b6a1f913ec5e8fa"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
