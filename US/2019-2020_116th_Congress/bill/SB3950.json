Such panel terminates 90 days after submitting its final report. (The Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice-presidential candidates gain a majority of electoral votes to win an election. In the event that no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the Twelfth Amendment requires the House of Representatives to elect the President and the Senate to elect the Vice President, which is known as a contingent election. The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution allows Congress to establish a process in the case of the death of a candidate in a contingent presidential or vice-presidential election.)","pending_committee_id":2331,"committee":{"committee_id":2331,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Rules And Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-11","committee_id":2331,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Rules And Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11966,"person_hash":"d5cx9z5s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rob Portman","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Portman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3094681,"votesmart_id":27008,"opensecrets_id":"N00003682","knowwho_pid":159002,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Portman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13466,"subject_name":"Congressional operations and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13389,"subject_name":"Libraries and archives"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199662,"date":"2020-07-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3950\/id\/2199662","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3950\/BILLS-116s3950is.pdf","text_size":305948,"text_hash":"6e421d816feb4b82b8a2dd92cca40aa4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
