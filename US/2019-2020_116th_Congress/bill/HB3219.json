Subject to narrow exceptions, a business appearing on such list is ineligible to receive federal grants or guaranteed loans for five years after the business is added to the list. Further, agencies must condition the awarding of government contracts on the requirement that any call center activity pursuant to the contract must be performed in the United States.Additionally, the bill requires call-center employees to disclose their physical location at the beginning of each call initiated or received, unless all employees of the business participating in the communication are located in the United States, among other exceptions.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and
