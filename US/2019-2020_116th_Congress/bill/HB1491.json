The FinTech Council is established within the Department of the Treasury. The council must designate, upon request by a fintech start-up, which federal financial regulators have exclusive oversight authority over that start-up. This designation lasts for two years and in general provides a safe harbor from enforcement actions by other regulators. To be eligible, a fintech start-up must meet certain requirements, including by demonstrating that they offer a financial innovation that serves the public interest. In each federal financial regulatory agency there is established an Office of Financial Innovation. Duties of the office include coordinating agency efforts to reduce regulatory burdens on eligible start-ups and conducting outreach to a start-up in the event of a regulatory action. The Advisory Council of FinTech Directors is established to provide advice to each federal financial regulator regarding the supervision of eligible fintech start-ups.","pending_committee_id":3246,"committee":{"committee_id":3246,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-04","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-27","committee_id":3246,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, and Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9126,"person_hash":"v86fk0xj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Scott","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-13","ftm_eid":13011507,"votesmart_id":7826,"opensecrets_id":"N00024871","knowwho_pid":193670,"ballotpedia":"David_Scott_(Georgia)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16468,"person_hash":"gs8koi0n","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barry Loudermilk","first_name":"Barry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loudermilk","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-11","ftm_eid":12999116,"votesmart_id":31618,"opensecrets_id":"N00035347","knowwho_pid":228409,"ballotpedia":"Barry_Loudermilk","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13727,"subject_name":"Product development and innovation"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1969126,"date":"2019-03-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1491\/id\/1969126","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1491\/BILLS-116hr1491ih.pdf","text_size":290134,"text_hash":"8747fab26e7503087a1430e9f9413059"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
