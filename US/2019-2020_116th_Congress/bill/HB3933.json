Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education to award grants to eligible states and Native American tribes to pay the federal share (75% of the average resident community college tuition and fees per student) of a program that provides funds to community colleges for waiving resident tuition and fees. The bill also requires each state to ensure that a participating institution offers academic credits that are fully transferable to a four-year institution. In addition, the bill establishes a grant program to encourage certain minority group students to enroll in and complete baccalaureate programs by requiring a university that receives grant funding to waive or significantly reduce tuition and fees for such students.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-24","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20080,"person_hash":"i6yhkxol","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andy Levin","first_name":"Andy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Levin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-9","ftm_eid":6479763,"votesmart_id":66287,"opensecrets_id":"N00042149","knowwho_pid":646744,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Levin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2250","sast_bill_id":1272079},{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4212","sast_bill_id":1273382},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4674","sast_bill_id":1276853}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13125,"subject_name":"Academic performance and assessments"},{"subject_id":13780,"subject_name":"Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13154,"subject_name":"Department of Education"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":81063,"subject_name":"Educational guidance"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":20700,"subject_name":"Minority employment"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048020,"date":"2019-08-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3933\/id\/2048020","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3933\/BILLS-116hr3933ih.pdf","text_size":419015,"text_hash":"bced01c463b8c9313454a3247cfd16a8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
