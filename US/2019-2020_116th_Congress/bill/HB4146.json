adoption of disciplinary procedures and practices that utilize evidence-based restorative practices that build a culture of trust; and activities that engage teachers and other staff in a process of school-based planning to help all students feel safe and connected to the school community.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-02","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-02","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-02","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16065,"person_hash":"05q57si5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Katherine Clark","first_name":"Katherine","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":20536475,"votesmart_id":35858,"opensecrets_id":"N00035278","knowwho_pid":263010,"ballotpedia":"Katherine_Clark","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9312,"person_hash":"pf1tkip8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Quigley","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Quigley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-5","ftm_eid":8785226,"votesmart_id":83310,"opensecrets_id":"N00030581","knowwho_pid":277349,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Quigley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20094,"person_hash":"8q0j3im4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ayanna Pressley","first_name":"Ayanna","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Pressley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-7","ftm_eid":45365104,"votesmart_id":122700,"opensecrets_id":"N00042581","knowwho_pid":234321,"ballotpedia":"Ayanna_Pressley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18327,"person_hash":"ne1btca3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jamie Raskin","first_name":"Jamie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Raskin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-8","ftm_eid":1066956,"votesmart_id":65904,"opensecrets_id":"N00037036","knowwho_pid":248823,"ballotpedia":"Jamie_Raskin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20069,"person_hash":"bfp27mah","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jahana Hayes","first_name":"Jahana","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hayes","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":45681143,"votesmart_id":181744,"opensecrets_id":"N00043421","knowwho_pid":666101,"ballotpedia":"Jahana_Hayes","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20055,"person_hash":"h6n01hyx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Antonio Delgado","first_name":"Antonio","middle_name":"","last_name":"Delgado","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-19","ftm_eid":44044927,"votesmart_id":180313,"opensecrets_id":"N00040741","knowwho_pid":617501,"ballotpedia":"Antonio_Delgado_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":81063,"subject_name":"Educational guidance"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049340,"date":"2019-08-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4146\/id\/2049340","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4146\/BILLS-116hr4146ih.pdf","text_size":366458,"text_hash":"290cafaa6af01cbb2daab5e26316f29b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
