The bill requires the community's water rights to be held in trust for the benefit of the community and its allottees. The community must enact a tribal water code to regulate its water rights. Among other things, the Department of the Interior must negotiate with Montana for the transfer of specified parcels of state land located on and off the reservation, hold transferred land in trust for the benefit of the community, allocate 20,000 acre-feet per year of stored water from Lake Elwell, establish a settlement trust fund, and request Montana to pay a specified amount to contribute to the design and construction of the Peoples Creek Dam and Reservoir to support mitigation activities. The bill requires the Bureau of Reclamation to modify the operating procedures of the Milk River Project to ensure that the Fresno Reservoir is operated in accordance with the agreement. The bill also outlines certain waivers, releases, and retention of claims under the settlement agreement.","pending_committee_id":4148,"committee":{"committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-24","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2020-01-27","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-24","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-27","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-27","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16497,"person_hash":"rbzlhjyc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ruben Gallego","first_name":"Ruben","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gallego","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-7","ftm_eid":6507394,"votesmart_id":123732,"opensecrets_id":"N00036097","knowwho_pid":293802,"ballotpedia":"Ruben_Gallego","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3113","sast_bill_id":1292590}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13808,"subject_name":"Alternative dispute resolution, mediation, arbitration"},{"subject_id":13541,"subject_name":"Dams and canals"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13397,"subject_name":"Government liability"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13547,"subject_name":"Historical and cultural resources"},{"subject_id":20689,"subject_name":"Hunting and fishing"},{"subject_id":13379,"subject_name":"Indian lands and resources rights"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13420,"subject_name":"Lakes and rivers"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13895,"subject_name":"Missouri River"},{"subject_id":13559,"subject_name":"Montana"},{"subject_id":13569,"subject_name":"Outdoor recreation"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13299,"subject_name":"Water resources funding"},{"subject_id":13393,"subject_name":"Water storage"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13300,"subject_name":"Watersheds"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2110538,"date":"2020-01-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5673\/id\/2110538","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5673\/BILLS-116hr5673ih.pdf","text_size":519505,"text_hash":"cc2ba276688f65b02158dc316a911062"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
