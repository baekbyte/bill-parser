The eight-hour ozone NAAQS measures ozone levels over eight-hour periods to determine the amount of ground-level ozone (i.e., smog) in the environment. The EPA (1) must issue a decision on each early action compact plan no later than one year after it is submitted, and (2) may not designate an area as a nonattainment area until it has issued a decision to approve or deny a plan. Under the bill, the EPA must establish separate requirements relating to winter ozone levels for each early action compact plan.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-25","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-25","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20296,"person_hash":"2w752buq","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mitt Romney","first_name":"Willard","middle_name":"Mitt","last_name":"Romney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":43351,"votesmart_id":21942,"opensecrets_id":"N00000286","knowwho_pid":213247,"ballotpedia":"Mitt_Romney","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2044888,"date":"2019-07-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1973\/id\/2044888","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1973\/BILLS-116s1973is.pdf","text_size":266912,"text_hash":"c0c074d283a8d92f04865f2e868f70d8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
