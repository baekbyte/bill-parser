Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall not detain or remove such a minor. The minor shall be eligible for nonimmigrant status, either dependent on the parent's status or otherwise, until a decision has been made on the minor's application for lawful permanent resident status. Such a minor shall also qualify as a derivative beneficiary child for immigrant visa purposes starting from the approval of the parent's employment-based immigration petition until a decision has been made on the minor's application for permanent resident status, even if the parent is deceased. These protections shall not apply if DHS determines that the minor poses a threat to public safety or national security.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-21","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
