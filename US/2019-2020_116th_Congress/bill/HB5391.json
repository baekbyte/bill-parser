Specifically, the bill requires the EPA to establish a grant program to provide funding for programs designed to (1) incentivize homeowners to replace old wood heaters with more efficient, cleaner-burning heaters; (2) achieve significant reductions in emissions from wood heaters; (3) help homeowners transition to safer and more efficient heating sources; and (4) support retailers, installers, and manufacturers that sell and make more efficient certified clean heaters. The EPA must also establish a program to (1) inform stakeholders of the benefits of replacing wood heaters that do not meet specified emission reductions standards, (2) develop nonfinancial incentives to promote the proper installation and use of certified clean heaters, and (3) consult with Indian tribes to implement programs and actions to reduce wood heater emissions. Finally, the bill authorizes the EPA to accept wood heater emissions reductions Supplemental Environmental Projects.","pending_committee_id":4135,"committee":{"committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-11","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-12-12","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9193,"person_hash":"4p9iymg5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cathy McMorris Rodgers","first_name":"Cathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McMorris Rodgers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-5","ftm_eid":2941046,"votesmart_id":3217,"opensecrets_id":"N00026314","knowwho_pid":199779,"ballotpedia":"Cathy_McMorris_Rodgers","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB2274","sast_bill_id":1272246}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13179,"subject_name":"Energy assistance for the poor and aged"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":321502,"subject_name":"Lighting, heating, cooling"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2079894,"date":"2019-12-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5391\/id\/2079894","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5391\/BILLS-116hr5391ih.pdf","text_size":344142,"text_hash":"dc8970d2f0b31b68ad337090857df08a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
