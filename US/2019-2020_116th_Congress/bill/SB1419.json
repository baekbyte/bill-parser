The advance notice must include, among other information, a written a description of the rule and the legal authority under which it is proposed; and solicit and provide a period of at least 60 days for submission of written data, views, and argument from interested persons. Any difference between such advance notice and the notice of proposed rulemaking may not be considered arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Advance notice is not required if the proposing agency is not required to publish notice of proposed rulemaking or OIRA finds that such advance notice is not in the public interest or duplicative of another statutory requirement. Such a determination made by OIRA is not subject to judicial review.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-13","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
