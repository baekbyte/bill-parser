The Department of Energy may establish a joint U.S.-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center in the United States to further dialogue and academic cooperation in energy innovation technology, water science, and technology transfer. An existing ban on transferring defense articles and services on the U.S. Munitions List to Cyprus is modified to allow for such transfers if Cyprus is the end user of the articles or services. Specifically, the State Department shall not deny exports, reexports or transfers of defense articles and services to or from Cyprus if the request is made by or on behalf of Cyprus and if Cyprus is the end user of such articles or services. No funds may be obligated or expended to facilitate the transfer of an F-35 aircraft (or to provide any related items or data) to Turkey unless the President certifies to Congress that Turkey does not plan to accept delivery of the S-400 air defense system from Russia. The State Department shall report on (1) a strategy for enhancing security and energy cooperation with Eastern Mediterranean countries, (2) malign Russian influence in the region, and (3) violations of Cyprus's exclusive economic zone and Greece's sovereign territory in the Aegean Sea.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland
