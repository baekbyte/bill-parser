Specifically, the bill requires the SBA to give a lender that makes a paycheck protection loan a reimbursement of $1,000 for each such loan, with graduated additional amounts distributed to a lender based on the amount of the loan. The bill also provides a further reimbursement of $250 for each paycheck protection loan that a lender with consolidated assets of less than $50 billion provides to a new customer. Further, the bill requires the SBA to determine whether demand for paycheck protection loans is likely to exceed any future appropriated amounts and, if so, to prioritize providing guarantees for loans of $300,000 or less.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8972,"person_hash":"iojagoko","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Foster","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foster","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-11","ftm_eid":16623751,"votesmart_id":101632,"opensecrets_id":"N00029139","knowwho_pid":263138,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Foster","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2187325,"date":"2020-05-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6755\/id\/2187325","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6755\/BILLS-116hr6755ih.pdf","text_size":310678,"text_hash":"c974ae9429a2120a064567482bad13cf"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
