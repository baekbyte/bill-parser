Current law requires the President to impose various financial, visa-blocking, and assistance sanctions on persons that knowingly facilitate the transfer of goods, services, or technology to Iran that would materially contribute to Iran's acquisition or development of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The bill expands such sanctions to cover transfers that materially support Iran's efforts to acquire or develop ballistic missile technologies or certain advanced conventional weapons. The bill also establishes additional sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program, including with respect to a foreign person or instrumentality of a foreign state that provides material support for Iran's efforts to acquire certain missile-related goods, services, technologies or weapons. The President shall notify Congress upon receiving credible information about certain conventional weapons transfers to Iran, with a determination of whether the transaction is subject to sanctions. The bill expands existing visa-blocking sanctions related to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to cover additional parties, including (1) foreign persons that provide significant financial services to the IRGC, and (2) Iranian persons subject to certain executive orders related to Syria. Such sanctions are further expanded to include property-blocking sanctions. The bill imposes various reporting requirements, including requirements for (1) an analysis of supply chains supporting Iran's ballistic missile program, and (2) a determination of Iran's use of commercial passenger aircraft for illicit military activities.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and
