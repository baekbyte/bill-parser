This prohibition applies to F (academic student) and J (exchange visitor) visas and does not apply to citizens or permanent residents of Taiwan or Hong Kong. (China considers Taiwan a Chinese province. Hong Kong is a special administrative region within China, and most of its permanent inhabitants are Chinese citizens.) The Department of State may waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis for national security purposes or if the applicant is a member of a religious or ethnic group that is systematically oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party. A recipient of a federal STEM research grant must certify that the recipient (1) is not a Chinese citizen or a participant in a Chinese government foreign researcher recruitment program (a program that compensates individuals to conduct STEM-related research and development), and (2) will not knowingly use grant funds to employ such an individual. Entities that receive certain federal research or education assistance shall not knowingly employ any individual participating in a Chinese government foreign researcher recruitment program. An individual who recruits or performs research for such a program must register as an agent of a foreign principal.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-09","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-09","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB7033","sast_bill_id":1367586}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13688,"subject_name":"Area studies and international education"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13592,"subject_name":"Political parties and affiliation"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13655,"subject_name":"Science and engineering education"},{"subject_id":13807,"subject_name":"Trade secrets and economic espionage"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199686,"date":"2020-07-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3920\/id\/2199686","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3920\/BILLS-116s3920is.pdf","text_size":310669,"text_hash":"cc2ed9dc10cbe16e69e70958358656fc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
