Specifically, the bill requires Treasury to provide certain funds to participating states, which such states shall use to administer specified approved programs that provide equity investment in new businesses. Certain areas with high levels of venture capital activity are excluded from the calculation of funds allocated to a participating state. Treasury shall also award funds to approved state programs to provide follow-on investments. If a state receives funds from an exit, the state shall use such funds to further invest in startups under the approved program. An exit is defined as the (1) acquisition of a startup in which a state has invested under the program; (2) sale of a share of such startup following an initial public offering; or (3) voluntary purchase of a state's ownership interest by the startup, investors, or existing shareholders.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-26","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-26","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-26","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20093,"person_hash":"uv1ly2v1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dean Phillips","first_name":"Dean","middle_name":"Benson","last_name":"Phillips","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-3","ftm_eid":14700222,"votesmart_id":181357,"opensecrets_id":"N00041134","knowwho_pid":626096,"ballotpedia":"Dean_Phillips","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18314,"person_hash":"mapln5bo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ro Khanna","first_name":"Ro","middle_name":"","last_name":"Khanna","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-17","ftm_eid":373494,"votesmart_id":29473,"opensecrets_id":"N00026427","knowwho_pid":281537,"ballotpedia":"Ro_Khanna","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9120,"person_hash":"9bus82xc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tim Ryan","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ryan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-13","ftm_eid":2850732,"votesmart_id":45638,"opensecrets_id":"N00025280","knowwho_pid":208806,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Ryan_(Ohio)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11201,"person_hash":"wknbt2m7","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Terri Sewell","first_name":"Terri","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Sewell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AL-7","ftm_eid":17657351,"votesmart_id":121621,"opensecrets_id":"N00030622","knowwho_pid":283908,"ballotpedia":"Terri_Sewell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20101,"person_hash":"yceo15jf","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Harley Rouda","first_name":"Harley","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rouda","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-48","ftm_eid":43645647,"votesmart_id":179404,"opensecrets_id":"N00040666","knowwho_pid":617606,"ballotpedia":"Harley_Rouda","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3515","sast_bill_id":1361200}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13727,"subject_name":"Product development and innovation"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177855,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6403\/id\/2177855","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6403\/BILLS-116hr6403ih.pdf","text_size":355374,"text_hash":"c6a7de8ade0618af8b5bca6b5036ceae"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
