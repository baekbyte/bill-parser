These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. An order from the EPA for comprehensive toxicity testing for PFAS shall require the development of information by any person who manufactures, processes, or intends to manufacture or process PFAS. The bill also provides guidelines for the development of these orders, including the methodologies and protocols to be used. Additionally, the bill specifies when a PFAS may be exempt from testing or information submission. Each person who manufactures or processes PFAS must submit to the EPA (1) all records of significant adverse reactions to health or the environment alleged to have been caused by PFAS, and (2) all health and safety studies related to PFAS of which the person is aware. The EPA must make all such health and safety studies available to the public within four months of the enactment of this bill.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-05-10","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14138,"person_hash":"oq69ym4f","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sean Maloney","first_name":"Sean","middle_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-18","ftm_eid":4512254,"votesmart_id":139760,"opensecrets_id":"N00034277","knowwho_pid":413491,"ballotpedia":"Sean_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16502,"person_hash":"fwdilijo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debbie Dingell","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dingell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-12","ftm_eid":252193,"votesmart_id":152482,"opensecrets_id":"N00036149","knowwho_pid":357079,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Dingell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20056,"person_hash":"64vfxa51","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Madeleine Dean","first_name":"Madeleine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dean","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-4","ftm_eid":4701392,"votesmart_id":136484,"opensecrets_id":"N00042894","knowwho_pid":569358,"ballotpedia":"Madeleine_Dean","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2025057,"date":"2019-05-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2608\/id\/2025057","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2608\/BILLS-116hr2608ih.pdf","text_size":210542,"text_hash":"162fe2f7198085bfbde1d94a837eb10e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
