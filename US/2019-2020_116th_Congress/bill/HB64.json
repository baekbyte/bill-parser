Specifically, the NIH must conduct and support basic and applied research to develop techniques for the isolation, derivation, production, testing, and human clinical use of stem cells that may result in improved understanding of, or treatments for, diseases and other adverse health conditions. However, such techniques must not involve (1) the creation of a human embryo for research purposes; (2) the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, a human embryo; or (3) the use of any stem cell the derivation or provision of which would be inconsistent with this bill. The NIH must also report on peer-reviewed stem cell research proposals that were not funded.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
