Specifically, the bill prohibits a cable franchising authority from (1) precluding the transfer of a cable franchise from a cable operator to a person to whom such franchise was not initially granted, or (2) requiring a cable operator that was initially granted a franchise to receive approval from the franchising authority for such a transfer. However, a franchising authority is authorized to require a cable operator to notify the authority of such a transfer.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-25","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9176,"person_hash":"cu7fgqvh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Burgess","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Burgess","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-26","ftm_eid":17658442,"votesmart_id":50120,"opensecrets_id":"N00025219","knowwho_pid":211708,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Burgess","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9269,"person_hash":"swa3u5tf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Virginia Foxx","first_name":"Virginia","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foxx","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-5","ftm_eid":6285984,"votesmart_id":6051,"opensecrets_id":"N00026166","knowwho_pid":196515,"ballotpedia":"Virginia_Foxx","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13137,"subject_name":"Broadcasting, cable, digital technologies"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13669,"subject_name":"Television and film"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2201259,"date":"2020-07-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7336\/id\/2201259","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7336\/BILLS-116hr7336ih.pdf","text_size":303773,"text_hash":"3b9d4afc374f7e6236f1f57d2ba04cf1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
