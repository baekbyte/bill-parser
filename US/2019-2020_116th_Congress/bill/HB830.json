The bill allows certain local variances from compliance with elevation and flood-proofing requirements for agricultural structures located in special flood hazard zones. The chargeable premium rate for coverage of a structure given a variance shall be the same as would otherwise apply if the structure had been dry floodproofed. The bill allows for alternative maps and risk-based rates for NFIP coverage in certain areas where levees fail to meet specified minimum standards.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-29","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
