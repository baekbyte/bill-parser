A service member may terminate a lease for premises or for a motor vehicle, and may not be charged an early termination fee for doing so, if the service member (1) enters into the lease upon receipt of certain military orders for permanent change of station, deployment with a military unit, or individual support of military operations; and (2) subsequently receives, in response to a local, national, or global emergency, a stop movement order for an indefinite period or at least 30 days. For the bill to apply in the case of a lease for premises, the stop movement order must prevent the service member or the service member's dependents from occupying the premises.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-06","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-10","action":"Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs discharged by Unanimous Consent.
