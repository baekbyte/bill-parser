The bill also excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, distributions up to $5,250 from employer-sponsored student loan and tuition payment plans. It repeals the limitation on the deduction of interest on student loans and increases from $15,000 to $25,000 (adjusted for inflation) the maximum contribution amounts for certain tax-preferred retirement plans. The bill allows employees an election to treat contributions to a 401(k) plan as Roth contributions (thus exempting withdrawals from such plans from tax at retirement).","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-11-19","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-11-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-11-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-11-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19646,"person_hash":"mdc8hgzr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debbie Lesko","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lesko","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-8","ftm_eid":12997825,"votesmart_id":106483,"opensecrets_id":"N00042056","knowwho_pid":267627,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Lesko","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2962","sast_bill_id":1286398}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2223348,"date":"2020-12-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8787\/id\/2223348","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8787\/BILLS-116hr8787ih.pdf","text_size":305813,"text_hash":"ff5082befc51205d2353b347f7a03110"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
