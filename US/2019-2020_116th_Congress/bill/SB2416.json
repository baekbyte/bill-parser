Specifically, under such a waiver, the governor's state may consolidate, replace, or alter eligibility requirements for two or more specified federal assistance programs related to nutrition, housing, income, foster care and adoption, and other social and community services. The board must evaluate waiver applications on the basis of whether a proposed project promotes employment, family stability, and financial literacy and savings with respect to program participants. Additionally, the bill excludes specified provisions from waiver authority and sets certain limits with respect to project funding.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-01","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16519,"person_hash":"39r6j2zz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joni Ernst","first_name":"Joni","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ernst","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6151700,"votesmart_id":128583,"opensecrets_id":"N00035483","knowwho_pid":328986,"ballotpedia":"Joni_Ernst","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20294,"person_hash":"1lllgwva","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Braun","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Braun","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":21084493,"votesmart_id":148564,"opensecrets_id":"N00041731","knowwho_pid":484213,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Braun","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16520,"person_hash":"pw88booc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"David Perdue","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perdue","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":12377537,"votesmart_id":151330,"opensecrets_id":"N00035516","knowwho_pid":474720,"ballotpedia":"David_Perdue","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13383,"subject_name":"Social welfare"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13179,"subject_name":"Energy assistance for the poor and aged"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":20754,"subject_name":"Family services"},{"subject_id":13872,"subject_name":"Financial literacy"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049038,"date":"2019-08-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2416\/id\/2049038","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2416\/BILLS-116s2416is.pdf","text_size":380948,"text_hash":"1b825d48489d6078a8dc47b42d860e14"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
