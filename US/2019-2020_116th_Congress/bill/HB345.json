Among other changes, the bill expands the grant program so that grants may be used to address emerging, infectious mosquito-borne diseases and to improve existing control programs. The CDC must also give preference to applicants that have (1) a public health emergency due to a mosquito-borne disease, or (2) a control program that is consistent with existing state preparedness plans. The bill also reauthorizes for FY2020-FY2024 and revises the CDC epidemiology and laboratory capacity grant program, which helps public health agencies improve surveillance and response activities related to infectious diseases.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18332,"person_hash":"fizx4b9o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darren Soto","first_name":"Darren","middle_name":"","last_name":"Soto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-9","ftm_eid":198924,"votesmart_id":67618,"opensecrets_id":"N00037422","knowwho_pid":255376,"ballotpedia":"Darren_Soto","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11056,"person_hash":"bh64wcwb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Vicky Hartzler","first_name":"Vicky","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hartzler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-4","ftm_eid":955870,"votesmart_id":8783,"opensecrets_id":"N00031005","knowwho_pid":284768,"ballotpedia":"Vicky_Hartzler","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB269","sast_bill_id":1142100}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":20694,"subject_name":"Insects"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":22815,"subject_name":"Pest management"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1867191,"date":"2019-01-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB345\/id\/1867191","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr345\/BILLS-116hr345ih.pdf","text_size":250871,"text_hash":"10773b5ffb743015221603429efada3a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
