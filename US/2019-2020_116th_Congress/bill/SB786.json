For entities that are certified by the Department of the Treasury as special access food providers using specified criteria, the bill allows tax credits for operating a new grocery store or renovating an existing grocery store in a food desert. The bill also authorizes grants for a portion of (1) the construction costs of building a permanent food bank in a food desert, and (2) the annual operating costs of temporary access merchants (mobile markets, farmers markets, and food banks). Treasury, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), must annually allocate the tax credits and grants to special access food providers. Grants authorized by this bill are not considered gross income for tax purposes. The bill also requires USDA to update the Food Access Research Atlas at least annually to account for food retailers that are placed in service during that year.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-13","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9305,"person_hash":"t3dzh81l","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jerry Moran","first_name":"Jerry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moran","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-1","ftm_eid":19889609,"votesmart_id":542,"opensecrets_id":"N00005282","knowwho_pid":158858,"ballotpedia":"Jerry_Moran","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9212,"person_hash":"l1ed938k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Shelley Capito","first_name":"Shelley","middle_name":"Moore","last_name":"Capito","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WV-2","ftm_eid":6651319,"votesmart_id":11701,"opensecrets_id":"N00009771","knowwho_pid":200084,"ballotpedia":"Shelley_Moore_Capito","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1717","sast_bill_id":1238950},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5030","sast_bill_id":1279796}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13817,"subject_name":"Agricultural marketing and promotion"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13511,"subject_name":"Food industry and services"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13523,"subject_name":"Retail and wholesale trades"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1980668,"date":"2019-04-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB786\/id\/1980668","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s786\/BILLS-116s786is.pdf","text_size":297648,"text_hash":"177a248205f45147adf5fd5980dcd46a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
