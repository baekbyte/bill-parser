The bill also requires the VA to advertise the availability of loan guarantees for housing cooperative share loans to notify eligible veterans, participating lenders, and interested realtors of the availability of such loan guarantees and the procedures and requirements that apply to the obtaining of such guarantees.","pending_committee_id":2316,"committee":{"committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-18","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9086,"person_hash":"1ztgbts1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Carolyn Maloney","first_name":"Carolyn","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-12","ftm_eid":17658243,"votesmart_id":26978,"opensecrets_id":"N00000078","knowwho_pid":158983,"ballotpedia":"Carolyn_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
