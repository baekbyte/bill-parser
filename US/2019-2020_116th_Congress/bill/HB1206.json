Currently, a child born outside the United States may automatically acquire citizenship through a parent by satisfying certain requirements. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish that this same citizenship path is available to non-citizen national minors. This path to citizenship is distinct from rights acquired at birth, and is open to individuals such as minors who were adopted by a U.S. citizen.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-13","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-03-25","committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-13","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17510,"person_hash":"xk8jisyh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Amata Radewagen","first_name":"Amata","middle_name":"Coleman","last_name":"Radewagen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AS","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":128380,"opensecrets_id":"N00007635","knowwho_pid":439739,"ballotpedia":"Aumua_Amata_Radewagen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
