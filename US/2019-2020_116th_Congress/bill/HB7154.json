Among other things, the bill specifically includes physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and other specified practitioners who are enrolled as Medicare suppliers as eligible suppliers who may receive COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) relief funds under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The bill also permanently allows physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists to provide telehealth services under Medicare, and includes specified therapy services as eligible Medicare telehealth services. (Currently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is authorized to waive requirements for Medicare telehealth services during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19, and it has done so to allow all providers that are otherwise eligible to furnish in-person services under Medicare to also furnish telehealth services.)","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
