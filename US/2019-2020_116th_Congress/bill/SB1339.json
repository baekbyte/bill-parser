The request must explain why the SBA disagreed with the certification and provide a factual basis for the statement. If it is determined, after agency review and reconsideration, that the proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the agency shall then perform an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis is prepared to ensure the agency has considered all reasonable regulatory alternatives that would minimize the rule's economic burdens or increase its benefits for the affected small entities, while achieving the objectives of the rule or statute.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-07","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
