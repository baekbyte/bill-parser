Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the geological formation. The bill prohibits federal agencies from issuing permits for the expansion of fracking or fracked oil and natural gas infrastructure, including infrastructure intended to extract, transport, or burn natural gas or oil. In addition, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to complete a survey of all oil and natural gas wells to identify the wells where fracking is, or has been, used. The survey must include a variety of data, including data on the proximity of fracking operations to inhabited structures (e.g., homes or schools). Beginning on February 1, 2021, the bill revokes permits for wells where fracking is, or has been, used within 2,500 feet of inhabited structures. The bill bans all fracking on onshore and offshore land by 2025. Finally, the bill requires the Department of Labor to establish a Just Transition Committee to make recommendations on ensuring the health and safety of individuals residing in, and the prosperity of, natural gas- and oil-producing regions during the phaseout of fracking.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-28","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB5857","sast_bill_id":1337611}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13128,"subject_name":"Aging"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13704,"subject_name":"Housing supply and affordability"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13392,"subject_name":"Pipelines"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2118198,"date":"2020-01-31","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3247\/id\/2118198","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3247\/BILLS-116s3247is.pdf","text_size":337772,"text_hash":"b54ec030d34f35bd7ef62a03ed8bfa25"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
