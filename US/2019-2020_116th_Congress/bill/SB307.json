Specifically, the bill prohibits a merger that materially (currently, substantially) lessens competition in more than a de minimis amount or tends to create a monopsony (a market situation in which there is only one buyer); shifts the burden of proof to the merging companies to show that their consolidation will not harm competition; requires companies that enter into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or Department of Justice regarding a merger to report information that allows the agencies to assess the competitive impact of the merger, and establishes the Office of the Competition Advocate within the FTC.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-31","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-31","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9408,"person_hash":"r7nps3ip","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Amy Klobuchar","first_name":"Amy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klobuchar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":17659011,"votesmart_id":65092,"opensecrets_id":"N00027500","knowwho_pid":248506,"ballotpedia":"Amy_Klobuchar","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9061,"person_hash":"yqm2ur4v","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mazie Hirono","first_name":"Mazie","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Hirono","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-2","ftm_eid":6401094,"votesmart_id":1677,"opensecrets_id":"N00028139","knowwho_pid":248294,"ballotpedia":"Mazie_Hirono","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1908355,"date":"2019-02-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB307\/id\/1908355","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s307\/BILLS-116s307is.pdf","text_size":295319,"text_hash":"6d3429e2c5bd7af0edfebc6e3fdee34c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
