Specifically, Creek Nation must restore full tribal citizenship to those individuals who can trace their ancestry to individuals listed on the 1906 Dawes Commission Rolls for the Creek Freedmen (i.e., Creek Freedmen, Freedmen, and Black Creeks). The bill also suspends the tribe's authority to conduct gaming or administer any funds from gaming until the tribe is in compliance with all treaty and federal obligations. The bill requires the Department of the Interior to (1) coordinate with federal agencies and receive reports from such agencies; (2) submit monthly compliance reports; and (3) issue a report on the status of Freedmen in the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole Nations of Oklahoma, including their access to tribal benefits. The Department of Justice must issue a finding on whether the civil rights of the Freedmen have been violated by the Creek Nation, Interior, or both. The bill establishes a private right of action for Freedmen. The bill directs the Government Accountability Office to issue an annual report on the tribe's expenditure of federal funds and whether the tribe is in full compliance with all federal laws related to the management and disbursement of such funds.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-04-04","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},{"date":"2019-05-03","committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9032,"person_hash":"fem2kor1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Danny Davis","first_name":"Danny","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-7","ftm_eid":16565454,"votesmart_id":233,"opensecrets_id":"N00004884","knowwho_pid":158834,"ballotpedia":"Danny_K._Davis","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13193,"subject_name":"Gambling"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13782,"subject_name":"Indian claims"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13567,"subject_name":"Oklahoma"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1984532,"date":"2019-04-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1514\/id\/1984532","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1514\/BILLS-116hr1514ih.pdf","text_size":312891,"text_hash":"f4fd52e12b14a8dcd56e14ccf4e27f9f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
