The OTF is an independent nonprofit organization within the purview of the USAGM that supports the development of internet freedom technologies that create ways to counter censorship efforts. As an independent grantee authorized by this bill, the OTF shall seek to advance freedom of the press and unrestricted internet access in repressive environments through functions such as researching, developing, implementing, and maintaining secure communications tools and technologies that circumvent censorship techniques used to limit or block access to the internet; advancing internet freedom by supporting private and public sector efforts to provide secure and uncensored access to the internet; and developing, acquiring, and distributing internet freedom technologies and techniques to fully enable the creation and distribution of digital content between and to all users and audiences. To advance freedom of the press and unrestricted internet access, the OTF shall use methods that include supporting fully open-source tools, code, and components that are as secure, transparent, and accessible as possible; supporting technologies that undergo comprehensive security audits; and establishing safeguards to mitigate the use of supported technologies for illicit purposes. The Department of State must report on the effectiveness of the OTF and the extent to which U.S. interests are being served by its work, and the Government Accountability Office shall have access to all information pertaining to financial transactions as may be necessary to facilitate an audit.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-21","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20297,"person_hash":"9aqi5rh3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rick Scott","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"Rick","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":422306,"votesmart_id":124204,"opensecrets_id":"N00043290","knowwho_pid":289276,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6621","sast_bill_id":1363669},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4049","sast_bill_id":1371366}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13137,"subject_name":"Broadcasting, cable, digital technologies"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13887,"subject_name":"Digital media"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13615,"subject_name":"International exchange and broadcasting"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13463,"subject_name":"Sovereignty, recognition, national governance and status"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2196483,"date":"2020-06-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3820\/id\/2196483","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3820\/BILLS-116s3820is.pdf","text_size":324397,"text_hash":"1e39a7cdd4f0400e191d2acc2b4a0221"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
