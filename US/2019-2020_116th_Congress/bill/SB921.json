Specifically, the bill prohibits the sale of any food that contains chlorpyrifos. The bill also prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from registering any pesticide containing chlorpyrifos as an active ingredient. Additionally, the EPA must cancel registration of any pesticide containing chlorpyrifos as an active ingredient. The bill prohibits the export of pesticides containing chlorpyrifos as an active ingredient to foreign countries. Currently, during emergency conditions, the EPA is authorized to exempt federal or state agencies from laws and regulations that govern the registration, distribution, sale, and use of pesticides. Under the bill, the EPA is prohibited from exempting federal and state agencies from such laws and regulations with respect to any pesticide containing chlorpyrifos as an active ingredient.","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And
