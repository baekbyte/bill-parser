The taxpayer may deduct contributions to such start-up accounts in the amount of $10,000, or $150,000, reduced by aggregate contributions for all taxable years, whichever is the lesser amount. Qualified distributions (e.g, for purchase of equipment, marketing, training, or accounting fees) from such accounts are excluded from gross income, for income tax purposes. The bill also imposes penalty taxes on excess contributions to a small business start-up savings account and for nonqualified distributions from such an account.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-19","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11052,"person_hash":"aa3xvp5z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Gardner","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gardner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5988870,"votesmart_id":30004,"opensecrets_id":"N00030780","knowwho_pid":210102,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Gardner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2086722,"date":"2020-01-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3136\/id\/2086722","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3136\/BILLS-116s3136is.pdf","text_size":340333,"text_hash":"62477c9a9fe40ab2f96e290216f0b04a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
