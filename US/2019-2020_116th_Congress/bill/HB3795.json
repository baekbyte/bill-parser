Specifically, a court may reduce the prison term for a defendant if (1) the imposed prison term was more than 10 years; (2) the defendant has served at least 10 years in custody; and (3) the court finds that the defendant is not a danger to public safety, is ready for reentry, and the interests of justice warrant a sentence modification. The bill outlines the factors a court may consider in reducing a prison term. Further, the bill creates a rebuttable presumption of sentence reduction for a defendant who is 50 years of age or older on the date of the petition.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-17","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-08-12","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9078,"person_hash":"7ingxztp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barbara Lee","first_name":"Barbara","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-13","ftm_eid":1263932,"votesmart_id":8315,"opensecrets_id":"N00008046","knowwho_pid":158726,"ballotpedia":"Barbara_Lee_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20094,"person_hash":"8q0j3im4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ayanna Pressley","first_name":"Ayanna","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Pressley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-7","ftm_eid":45365104,"votesmart_id":122700,"opensecrets_id":"N00042581","knowwho_pid":234321,"ballotpedia":"Ayanna_Pressley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9022,"person_hash":"2xeb8jst","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lacy Clay","first_name":"Lacy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Clay","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-1","ftm_eid":3798170,"votesmart_id":8967,"opensecrets_id":"N00012460","knowwho_pid":205779,"ballotpedia":"William_Lacy_Clay","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16500,"person_hash":"84vk12iq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Lieu","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lieu","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-33","ftm_eid":2451821,"votesmart_id":1516,"opensecrets_id":"N00035825","knowwho_pid":240581,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Lieu","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2146","sast_bill_id":1271640}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047916,"date":"2019-08-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3795\/id\/2047916","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3795\/BILLS-116hr3795ih.pdf","text_size":374993,"text_hash":"8ffae200a7ea273c17770de4da205ca1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
