It limits to $250 million the amount that may be expended for military construction projects in the event of a national emergency declaration for its duration. Additionally, any appropriated funds used must be otherwise not executable. It restricts authority to waive or disregard a requirement that would otherwise apply to such a construction project. The bill requires any decision to undertake such a project to congressional notification requirements that include an explanation of why the use of the Armed Forces is required to respond to a national emergency, how a project supports the needs of members of the Armed Forces, estimates of construction costs, determinations to waive or disregard other law affecting construction authority, and reference to projects that would be subject to cancellation or deferment in order to provide construction funds to address such an emergency.","pending_committee_id":2360,"committee":{"committee_id":2360,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
