Under current law, a state Medicaid program must cover former foster youth until the age of 26 if the youth were in the state's foster care system at the age of 18 and were enrolled in the state's Medicaid program while in foster care; a state may choose to also cover former foster youth from other states. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act altered these provisions to require a state Medicaid program to cover former foster youth from other states until the age of 26; such changes apply to former foster youth who reach the age of 18 on or after January 1, 2023. The bill instead applies these changes to former foster youth who reach the age of 18 on or after the date of enactment of this bill.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9095,"person_hash":"dfoj059c","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gwen Moore","first_name":"Gwen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moore","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-4","ftm_eid":2653235,"votesmart_id":3457,"opensecrets_id":"N00026914","knowwho_pid":199871,"ballotpedia":"Gwen_Moore","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20117,"person_hash":"k70n0p91","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Trone","first_name":"David","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Trone","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-6","ftm_eid":5631712,"votesmart_id":167336,"opensecrets_id":"N00039122","knowwho_pid":568351,"ballotpedia":"David_Trone","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9068,"person_hash":"ludkkyov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sheila Jackson-Lee","first_name":"Sheila","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jackson-Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-18","ftm_eid":6716263,"votesmart_id":21692,"opensecrets_id":"N00005818","knowwho_pid":159088,"ballotpedia":"Sheila_Jackson_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9035,"person_hash":"g25cpbse","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rosa DeLauro","first_name":"Rosa","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"DeLauro","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-3","ftm_eid":5349073,"votesmart_id":26788,"opensecrets_id":"N00000615","knowwho_pid":158778,"ballotpedia":"Rosa_DeLauro","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19694,"person_hash":"gdvbkhz9","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mary Gay Scanlon","first_name":"Mary","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scanlon","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-5","ftm_eid":44954452,"votesmart_id":178890,"opensecrets_id":"N00042706","knowwho_pid":655204,"ballotpedia":"Mary_Gay_Scanlon","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3057","sast_bill_id":1266316},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1697","sast_bill_id":1266299},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8200","sast_bill_id":1377831}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2193751,"date":"2020-06-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6959\/id\/2193751","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6959\/BILLS-116hr6959ih.pdf","text_size":305932,"text_hash":"c6afd6277cf7310836d170cd8c8a69fb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
