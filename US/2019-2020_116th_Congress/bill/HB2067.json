The President shall establish an interagency task force to improve effectiveness of trade-capacity-building assistance programs. The task force shall have members from relevant executive branch agencies including the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. The task force shall (1) review executive branch agency expenditures on trade-capacity-building assistance, and (2) make recommendations to the President as to the appropriate allocations of such funds. The State Department shall (1) have primary responsibility for overseeing and carrying out such assistance programs, (2) prioritize assistance to certain countries such as those that have consistently supported policies that promote the development of private enterprise, and (3) ensure that the programs are not duplicative. The bill also establishes that one goal of each mission to a foreign country shall be to (1) identify local barriers to international trade and investment, (2) advise the State Department on trade-capacity-building assistance, and (3) coordinate and supervise trade-capacity-building assistance programs. The Government Accountability Office shall periodically review the impact of the trade-capacity-assistance programs.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-03","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20066,"person_hash":"j5fkx86s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Guest","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"","last_name":"Guest","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MS-3","ftm_eid":16352053,"votesmart_id":179667,"opensecrets_id":"N00042458","knowwho_pid":651006,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Guest","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9192,"person_hash":"77p1skl0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael McCaul","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McCaul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-10","ftm_eid":15456789,"votesmart_id":49210,"opensecrets_id":"N00026460","knowwho_pid":226551,"ballotpedia":"Michael_McCaul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20106,"person_hash":"plq6uczb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ross Spano","first_name":"Ross","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-15","ftm_eid":13889263,"votesmart_id":142164,"opensecrets_id":"N00043319","knowwho_pid":425567,"ballotpedia":"Ross_Spano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13682,"subject_name":"Africa"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13743,"subject_name":"Free trade and trade barriers"},{"subject_id":13849,"subject_name":"Multilateral development programs"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1996178,"date":"2019-04-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2067\/id\/1996178","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2067\/BILLS-116hr2067ih.pdf","text_size":306346,"text_hash":"14023a52084dc9dfb5dd4d7a1019aa22"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
