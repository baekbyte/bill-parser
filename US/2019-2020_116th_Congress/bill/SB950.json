Perfluorinated compounds are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain perfluorinated compounds, such as nonstick cookware, waterproof clothing, stain-resistant fabrics, food packaging, and fire-fighting foams. The bill requires the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to establish a performance standard for the detection of perfluorinated compounds. Using such standard, the USGS must carry out a nationwide sampling to determine the concentration of perfluorinated compounds in estuaries, lakes, streams, springs, wells, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and soil. The sampling data must then be used to inform and enhance assessments of exposure, likely health and environmental impacts, and remediation priorities.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9415,"person_hash":"m7c3vp1o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Debbie Stabenow","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stabenow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MI","ftm_eid":10688869,"votesmart_id":515,"opensecrets_id":"N00004118","knowwho_pid":205511,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Stabenow","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16521,"person_hash":"0gww5x7w","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Rounds","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rounds","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SD","ftm_eid":6580808,"votesmart_id":7455,"opensecrets_id":"N00035187","knowwho_pid":198882,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Rounds","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9486,"person_hash":"1riyfn00","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Burr","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burr","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":6860429,"votesmart_id":21787,"opensecrets_id":"N00002221","knowwho_pid":158938,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Burr","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18486,"person_hash":"8009qp8o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Margaret Hassan","first_name":"Margaret","middle_name":"Wood","last_name":"Hassan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":9693318,"votesmart_id":42552,"opensecrets_id":"N00038397","knowwho_pid":227982,"ballotpedia":"Maggie_Hassan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1976","sast_bill_id":1246611},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1507","sast_bill_id":1262194}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13420,"subject_name":"Lakes and rivers"},{"subject_id":13745,"subject_name":"Soil pollution"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13427,"subject_name":"Wetlands"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1990147,"date":"2019-04-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB950\/id\/1990147","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s950\/BILLS-116s950is.pdf","text_size":280841,"text_hash":"be921f309fdc2dce389f34ce59fffc41"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
