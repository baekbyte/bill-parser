Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement a direct federal-aid highway program that permits a state to (1) waive its right to receive funds under the program, and (2) receive a prorated amount of taxes apportioned to the Highway Trust Fund (other than for the Mass Transit Account); sets forth responsibilities for states that elect to waive their rights, including that such states must agree to obligate or expend program amounts exclusively for projects that are eligible for surface transportation program funding; and directs DOT to implement a similar alternative funding program for public transportation programs.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11966,"person_hash":"d5cx9z5s","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rob Portman","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Portman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3094681,"votesmart_id":27008,"opensecrets_id":"N00003682","knowwho_pid":159002,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Portman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1958920,"date":"2019-03-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB615\/id\/1958920","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s615\/BILLS-116s615is.pdf","text_size":295296,"text_hash":"7a9d6988c5b30654b45d1e4aa1bd50b0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
