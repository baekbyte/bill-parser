A generative adversarial network is a software system designed to be trained with authentic inputs (e.g., photographs) to generate similar, but artificial, outputs (e.g., deepfakes). Specifically, the NSF must support research on manipulated or synthesized content and information authenticity and the NIST must support research for the development of measurements and standards necessary to accelerate the development of the technological tools to examine the function and outputs of generative adversarial networks or other technologies that synthesize or manipulate content.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-20","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-20","action":"Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
