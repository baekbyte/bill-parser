The partnership must be established under the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Among other requirements, the partnership must (1) promote data sharing between partners, (2) analyze data to identify fraudulent practices, (3) refer potential criminal cases to law enforcement, and (4) conduct education and outreach. Currently, HHS and DOJ administer the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership. The purpose of the partnership is to address health care fraud through voluntary data sharing between public and private sectors; the partnership was created in 2012 through agency action. The bill transfers all functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and administrative actions of this partnership to the partnership established under the bill.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-11","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2019-02-26","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-25","action":"Mr. Engel moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-25","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
