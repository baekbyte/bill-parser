Specifically, the bill applies a minimum area wage adjustment to payments to sole community hospitals that are located up to 75 miles from the closest frontier (i.e., predominantly rural) state. Currently, the minimum area wage adjustment applies only to hospitals in frontier states. The bill also allows such sole community hospitals to participate in the 340B drug pricing program (i.e., a program that allows entities to receive covered outpatient drugs at reduced prices from manufacturers).","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-02-26","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-26","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9154,"person_hash":"0gala4ad","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Collin Peterson","first_name":"Collin","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peterson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-7","ftm_eid":16588347,"votesmart_id":26926,"opensecrets_id":"N00004558","knowwho_pid":158917,"ballotpedia":"Collin_Peterson","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11144,"person_hash":"ojklk0v4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Tipton","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tipton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-3","ftm_eid":6022986,"votesmart_id":65403,"opensecrets_id":"N00027509","knowwho_pid":267906,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Tipton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9213,"person_hash":"86i58pyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Cole","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cole","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-4","ftm_eid":14964187,"votesmart_id":46034,"opensecrets_id":"N00025726","knowwho_pid":211693,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cole_(Oklahoma)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5103","sast_bill_id":1280543}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1942576,"date":"2019-03-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1323\/id\/1942576","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1323\/BILLS-116hr1323ih.pdf","text_size":277738,"text_hash":"02c204b43243881caa07fa9655c4f42d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
