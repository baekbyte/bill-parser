The bill applies to \"special veterans,\" defined as persons who served in the active Armed Forces, who were (1) honorably discharged or released; (2) not convicted of various crimes, including voluntary manslaughter, murder, rape, or terrorism; and (3) not a child abuser or pedophile. Special veterans shall not be removed from the United States, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall cancel any pending removal proceedings or orders against any such veterans. DHS shall establish a program to permit such veterans who were already removed from the United States to return to as an alien with permanent residence status. Such veterans shall be entitled to all of the military benefits that they would be entitled to if they had never been removed from the United States. Special veterans shall be naturalized upon filing an application, paying the relevant fees, and taking an oath of allegiance. DHS shall take steps to ensure such naturalization applications are pending for no longer than 90 days.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and
