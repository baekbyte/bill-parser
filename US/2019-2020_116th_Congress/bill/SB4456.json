Specifically, the ONC must, within 90 days, make available a USPS tool that automatically formats addresses into the correct standard to health care providers and laboratories that test for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) at no cost. The USPS currently provides this tool to online retailers at no cost. In addition, the ONC must update regulations to require, as a condition of certification, that health information technology use the USPS standard for postal addresses.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-05","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18486,"person_hash":"8009qp8o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Margaret Hassan","first_name":"Margaret","middle_name":"Wood","last_name":"Hassan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":9693318,"votesmart_id":42552,"opensecrets_id":"N00038397","knowwho_pid":227982,"ballotpedia":"Maggie_Hassan","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9255,"person_hash":"8t4a6t34","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bill Cassidy","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cassidy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":6673315,"votesmart_id":69494,"opensecrets_id":"N00030245","knowwho_pid":266763,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Cassidy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13355,"subject_name":"Postal service"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206667,"date":"2020-08-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4456\/id\/2206667","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4456\/BILLS-116s4456is.pdf","text_size":302349,"text_hash":"40b78b2f86d57b17047250da2b9f90c8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
