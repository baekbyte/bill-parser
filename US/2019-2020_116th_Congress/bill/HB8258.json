The program must improve fuel cycle performance and support a variety of options for used nuclear fuel storage, use, and disposal, including advanced nuclear reactor concepts. In carrying out the program, DOE must ensure all activities and designs incorporate state of the art safeguards technologies and techniques to reduce risk of proliferation. In addition, DOE must consider the potential benefits and other impacts of those activities for civilian nuclear applications, environmental health and safety, and national security. DOE must also consider the economic viability of all activities and designs.","pending_committee_id":2313,"committee":{"committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-15","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20081,"person_hash":"cn1wguew","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Levin","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Levin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-49","ftm_eid":44044456,"votesmart_id":179416,"opensecrets_id":"N00040667","knowwho_pid":617967,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Levin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6097","sast_bill_id":1356772}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13785,"subject_name":"Metals"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13693,"subject_name":"Nuclear power"},{"subject_id":13603,"subject_name":"Radioactive wastes and releases"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13891,"subject_name":"Technology assessment"},{"subject_id":13658,"subject_name":"Technology transfer and commercialization"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2209317,"date":"2020-09-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8258\/id\/2209317","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8258\/BILLS-116hr8258ih.pdf","text_size":297651,"text_hash":"860861643ee02ee0db0a8bb49d21655c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
