The bill outlines the tribe's water rights, including the right to divert, use, and store 4,000 acre-feet of agricultural priority water of the Central Arizona Project that was previously allocated to nontribal agricultural entities, but retained by the Department of the Interior for reallocation to tribes in Arizona pursuant to the Central Arizona Project Settlement Act of 2004. The Bureau of Reclamation must construct the Hualapai Water Project. The project must be designed to divert, treat, and convey at least 3,414 acre-feet of water per year from the Colorado River for municipal, commercial, and industrial uses on the Hualapai Reservation. The bill provides for land to be added to the reservation and taken into trust for the benefit of the tribe. In the future, land located outside the reservation may only be taken into trust through an act of Congress. The bill outlines (1) waivers, releases, and retentions of claims by the tribe and the United States under the settlement agreement; and (2) a limited waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States and the tribe with respect to certain claims.","pending_committee_id":2335,"committee":{"committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-01","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2459","sast_bill_id":1256048}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13536,"subject_name":"Arizona"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13782,"subject_name":"Indian claims"},{"subject_id":13379,"subject_name":"Indian lands and resources rights"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13420,"subject_name":"Lakes and rivers"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2010694,"date":"2019-05-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1277\/id\/2010694","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1277\/BILLS-116s1277is.pdf","text_size":463703,"text_hash":"a9c763042a5af2da295432e79e90ed6f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
