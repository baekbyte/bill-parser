Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to disclose to the Department of Education any gift from or contract with a foreign entity or individual valued at $50,000 or more. Currently, an IHE must make such a disclosure if the gift or contract is valued at $250,000 or more. An IHE must report, if available, the purpose of the gift or contract. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on IHEs' compliance with these disclosure requirements.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-23","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14906,"person_hash":"4hczcvbn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Perry","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-4","ftm_eid":13005805,"votesmart_id":59980,"opensecrets_id":"N00034120","knowwho_pid":248703,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Perry","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18305,"person_hash":"nduyjfng","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Matt Gaetz","first_name":"Matt","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaetz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-1","ftm_eid":12998496,"votesmart_id":117101,"opensecrets_id":"N00039503","knowwho_pid":286600,"ballotpedia":"Matt_Gaetz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13615,"subject_name":"International exchange and broadcasting"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047883,"date":"2019-08-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3921\/id\/2047883","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3921\/BILLS-116hr3921ih.pdf","text_size":361595,"text_hash":"46d9f5b9b26be7f9fb70464c111e54eb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
