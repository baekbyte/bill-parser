An additional $500 rebate is provided to each qualifying child of the taxpayer. A recovery rebate is a one-time stimulus payment made to eligible taxpayers in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. The amount of the recovery rebate is reduced by a specified percentage of the amount an individual's adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). Individual taxpayers and their children must have a valid identification number (i.e., Social Security account number) to claim a rebate. The Department of the Treasury must conduct a public awareness campaign to inform taxpayers of the availability of the rebate.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-12-10","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-12-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4318","sast_bill_id":1374557},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB748","sast_bill_id":1173017}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2223827,"date":"2020-12-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4999\/id\/2223827","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4999\/BILLS-116s4999is.pdf","text_size":297135,"text_hash":"39a44a7f8142e3ff2060ff6adc33782d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
