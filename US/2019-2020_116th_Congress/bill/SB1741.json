As part of its research and development, DOE must pay special attention to energy storage needs and opportunities that are relatively underdeveloped and potentially transformative for the electric grid. DOE must develop cost targets (e.g., technology costs, installation costs, balance of services costs, and soft costs) for energy storage across all types of energy storage technology.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
