The credit is equal to 10% of the purchase price of the residence, which may not exceed $1.5 million. The dollar amount of the credit is limited to $8,000 in a taxable year. The bill allows the chief executive officer (e.g., governor) of a state to designate certain population census tracts in areas related to federally declared disasters as opportunity zones. This makes investments in the areas eligible for various tax incentives.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-17","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18300,"person_hash":"pzu9xprp","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Neal Dunn","first_name":"Neal","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Dunn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-2","ftm_eid":117671,"votesmart_id":166297,"opensecrets_id":"N00037442","knowwho_pid":547694,"ballotpedia":"Neal_Dunn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20110,"person_hash":"a7fpcibx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Greg Steube","first_name":"Greg","middle_name":"","last_name":"Steube","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-17","ftm_eid":6692870,"votesmart_id":117248,"opensecrets_id":"N00042808","knowwho_pid":289471,"ballotpedia":"Greg_Steube","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1851","sast_bill_id":1243253}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13498,"subject_name":"Capital gains tax"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13587,"subject_name":"Income tax deferral"},{"subject_id":13442,"subject_name":"Natural disasters"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047536,"date":"2019-07-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3790\/id\/2047536","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3790\/BILLS-116hr3790ih.pdf","text_size":372032,"text_hash":"3503db06d290a49d13b22686dcd34172"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
