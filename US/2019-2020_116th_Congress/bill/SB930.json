The bill also removes the limit on employee contributions to flexible spending accounts offered under specified health plans established pursuant to a pretax salary reduction agreement with an employer (i.e., cafeteria plans). Further, the bill requires the Food and Drug Administration to give priority review, at no cost, to applications for modifications to already-approved contraceptive drugs that are intended for routine use and available over the counter. Such drugs, however, must require a prescription for individuals under the age of 18.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16519,"person_hash":"39r6j2zz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joni Ernst","first_name":"Joni","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ernst","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6151700,"votesmart_id":128583,"opensecrets_id":"N00035483","knowwho_pid":328986,"ballotpedia":"Joni_Ernst","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11052,"person_hash":"aa3xvp5z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Gardner","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gardner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5988870,"votesmart_id":30004,"opensecrets_id":"N00030780","knowwho_pid":210102,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Gardner","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1089","sast_bill_id":1250728}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13622,"subject_name":"Family planning and birth control"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1989138,"date":"2019-04-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB930\/id\/1989138","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s930\/BILLS-116s930is.pdf","text_size":276846,"text_hash":"bfcff65d645bfead4ee69b7663ac3a8a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
