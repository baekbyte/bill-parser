Specifically, it removes silencers from the list of firearms subject to regulation (i.e., registration and licensing requirements) under the National Firearms Act (NFA). Additionally, it excludes a muffler or silencer from the list of firearms subject to regulation (e.g., background check requirements) under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). Finally, the bill does the following: preempts state or local laws that tax or regulate firearm silencers, specifies that a person who lawfully acquires or possesses a silencer under provisions of the GCA meets the registration and licensing requirements of the NFA, eliminates mandatory minimum prison terms for a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense in which a defendant uses or carries a firearm equipped with a silencer or muffler, and permits active and retired law enforcement officers to carry a concealed silencer.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-24","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9284,"person_hash":"k56piu5q","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve King","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-4","ftm_eid":6587767,"votesmart_id":10853,"opensecrets_id":"N00025237","knowwho_pid":193968,"ballotpedia":"Steve_King_(Iowa)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB202","sast_bill_id":1172982},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB155","sast_bill_id":1137325},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB817","sast_bill_id":1239600}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13185,"subject_name":"Federal preemption"},{"subject_id":13341,"subject_name":"Firearms and explosives"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1899968,"date":"2019-02-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB775\/id\/1899968","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr775\/BILLS-116hr775ih.pdf","text_size":278992,"text_hash":"10a3ed14b97ed21ab10171ebccad0881"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
