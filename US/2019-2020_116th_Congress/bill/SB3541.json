Specifically, the bill authorizes the Small Business Administration to forgive the outstanding principal balance of a small business disaster loan made in response to COVID-19 if the borrower maintains all of its employees at full pay and benefits throughout the duration of the declared national emergency. The bill also raises the maximum amount for a disaster loan made in response to COVID-19, and it waives the requirement that a borrower demonstrate an inability to obtain credit elsewhere.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-19","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177819,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3541\/id\/2177819","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3541\/BILLS-116s3541is.pdf","text_size":312430,"text_hash":"ce7e34bb92b9873622fdd9680a064c2a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
