Specifically, the bill provides authority for active duty and reserve Coast Guard officers to request to be excluded from consideration by a selection board for promotion, temporary promotion authority for Coast Guard officers in certain grades with critical skills, and authority for a program under which members of the Coast Guard may be temporarily inactivated from active service for no more than three years to meet personal or professional needs. The Department of Homeland Security must (1) establish a database to record all training performed by members of the Coast Guard that may be applicable to employment in the civilian sector, and (2) make the training information available to state employment agencies and other potential employers.","pending_committee_id":2550,"committee":{"committee_id":2550,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-03","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-06-04","committee_id":2550,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20059,"person_hash":"xs2edxvf","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Fletcher","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"Pannill","last_name":"Fletcher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-7","ftm_eid":44045104,"votesmart_id":177031,"opensecrets_id":"N00041194","knowwho_pid":625330,"ballotpedia":"Lizzie_Pannill_Fletcher","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14922,"person_hash":"m6il9679","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Randy Weber","first_name":"Randy","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Weber","suffix":"Sr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-14","ftm_eid":13006857,"votesmart_id":102026,"opensecrets_id":"N00033539","knowwho_pid":269711,"ballotpedia":"Randy_Weber","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3409","sast_bill_id":1269875},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2297","sast_bill_id":1272219}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13813,"subject_name":"Coast guard"},{"subject_id":81065,"subject_name":"Employee performance"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2043202,"date":"2019-06-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3066\/id\/2043202","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3066\/BILLS-116hr3066ih.pdf","text_size":274659,"text_hash":"244bebed1dc8a2b63e3c45f88059c026"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
