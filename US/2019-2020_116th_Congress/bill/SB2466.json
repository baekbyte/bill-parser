Specifically, the bill provides $50 billion in FY2020 supplemental appropriations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for programs that reduce contaminants of concern in drinking water, such as grant programs for lead testing or remediation efforts in schools, child care programs, or high-risk communities. The funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules. Each year, the EPA must obligate specified amounts of funding for several water infrastructure programs, including state revolving fund programs and grant programs for managing or controlling water pollution. The EPA must also establish a grant program to help communities that serve environmentally at-risk households and low-income households afford the costs for remediating contaminated drinking water. Further, the Department of Health and Human Services may make grants to states to assist low-income households in meeting their needs for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater services. In addition, the EPA must promulgate an interim national primary drinking water regulation for perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, which may have adverse human health effects. Finally, the bill establishes or reauthorizes a variety of programs that provide financial support for water supply projects, water recycling or reuse projects, rural water systems, water efficiency improvements, or conservation programs.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-11","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4033","sast_bill_id":1272180},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1162","sast_bill_id":1203256}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13396,"subject_name":"Alaska"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13536,"subject_name":"Arizona"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13391,"subject_name":"California"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13539,"subject_name":"Colorado"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13542,"subject_name":"Ecology"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13310,"subject_name":"Hawaii"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":20689,"subject_name":"Hunting and fishing"},{"subject_id":13549,"subject_name":"Idaho"},{"subject_id":13226,"subject_name":"Income tax exclusion"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13584,"subject_name":"Kansas"},{"subject_id":13335,"subject_name":"Marine and coastal resources, fisheries"},{"subject_id":13559,"subject_name":"Montana"},{"subject_id":13509,"subject_name":"Nebraska"},{"subject_id":13561,"subject_name":"Nevada"},{"subject_id":13563,"subject_name":"New Mexico"},{"subject_id":13565,"subject_name":"North Dakota"},{"subject_id":13567,"subject_name":"Oklahoma"},{"subject_id":13568,"subject_name":"Oregon"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13676,"subject_name":"South Dakota"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13573,"subject_name":"Texas"},{"subject_id":13575,"subject_name":"Utah"},{"subject_id":13578,"subject_name":"Washington State"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13299,"subject_name":"Water resources funding"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13300,"subject_name":"Watersheds"},{"subject_id":13301,"subject_name":"Wilderness and natural areas, wildlife refuges, wild rivers, habitats"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"},{"subject_id":13582,"subject_name":"Wyoming"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053498,"date":"2019-09-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2466\/id\/2053498","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2466\/BILLS-116s2466is.pdf","text_size":447869,"text_hash":"7b663ba51faea9228f440729cfa13f38"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
