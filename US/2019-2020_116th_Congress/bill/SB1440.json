Specifically, this restriction does not apply in certain instances involving (1) an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens, (2) persons bringing in and harboring aliens in violation of immigration laws, and (3) an alien illegally present in the United States who had previously left or was deported after being convicted of a felony. The bill repeals the authority allowing the Department of Justice to enter into agreements authorizing state or local government employees to perform immigration enforcement functions.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-14","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9405,"person_hash":"i4x14koe","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Durbin","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Durbin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":3414130,"votesmart_id":26847,"opensecrets_id":"N00004981","knowwho_pid":165219,"ballotpedia":"Dick_Durbin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9061,"person_hash":"yqm2ur4v","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mazie Hirono","first_name":"Mazie","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Hirono","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-2","ftm_eid":6401094,"votesmart_id":1677,"opensecrets_id":"N00028139","knowwho_pid":248294,"ballotpedia":"Mazie_Hirono","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2729","sast_bill_id":1261130}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13305,"subject_name":"Citizenship and naturalization"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2029582,"date":"2019-05-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1440\/id\/2029582","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1440\/BILLS-116s1440is.pdf","text_size":204683,"text_hash":"90f486c89742931445796c29324a6924"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
