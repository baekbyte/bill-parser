Specifically, all private student loan agreements must (1) prohibit a creditor from declaring a default or accelerating the debt of a private student loan on the sole basis of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner to such a loan, and (2) require loan holders to release cosigners from any obligation upon the death of the student borrower. Under current law, these protections apply only to private student loan agreements entered into on or after November 20, 2018.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-16","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20048,"person_hash":"3uco5608","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Angela Craig","first_name":"Angela","middle_name":"Dawn","last_name":"Craig","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-2","ftm_eid":32141809,"votesmart_id":166261,"opensecrets_id":"N00037039","knowwho_pid":536254,"ballotpedia":"Angie_Craig","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2203859,"date":"2020-08-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7625\/id\/2203859","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7625\/BILLS-116hr7625ih.pdf","text_size":299211,"text_hash":"ac3c30f1035ec8b4c74bb71ba8b493d7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
