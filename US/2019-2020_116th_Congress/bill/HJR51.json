The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing.The amendment also prohibits total outlays for any fiscal year from exceeding 18% of the economic output of the United States unless two-thirds of each chamber of Congress provides a specific increase in outlays above this amount, requires a three-fourths roll call vote of each chamber of Congress to increase the public debt limit, requires a two-thirds roll call vote of each chamber of Congress to increase revenue, requires the President to transmit to Congress a proposed balanced budget each year and prohibits the President from being compensated if the requirement is not met, and requires Congress to consider and approve a balanced budget each year and prohibits Members of Congress from being compensated if the requirement is not met. Congress may waive these requirements when a declaration of war is in effect or if the United States is engaged in a military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security. The amendment prohibits a court from entering an order in any action that results in an increase in the collection of revenue.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-14","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16475,"person_hash":"4li3sl2a","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Ratcliffe","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ratcliffe","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-4","ftm_eid":18661779,"votesmart_id":147381,"opensecrets_id":"N00035972","knowwho_pid":478372,"ballotpedia":"John_Ratcliffe","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16449,"person_hash":"q4j4scaf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Babin","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Babin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-36","ftm_eid":11282531,"votesmart_id":360,"opensecrets_id":"N00005736","knowwho_pid":481703,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Babin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20124,"person_hash":"rdxharuy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ron Wright","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wright","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-6","ftm_eid":44105354,"votesmart_id":78666,"opensecrets_id":"N00042240","knowwho_pid":206142,"ballotpedia":"Ronald_Wright","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20100,"person_hash":"cqzhn7pe","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chip Roy","first_name":"Chip","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-21","ftm_eid":44449969,"votesmart_id":177319,"opensecrets_id":"N00042268","knowwho_pid":223268,"ballotpedia":"Chip_Roy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11049,"person_hash":"tzdxxeto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Duncan","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duncan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-3","ftm_eid":8045191,"votesmart_id":47967,"opensecrets_id":"N00030752","knowwho_pid":213970,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Duncan_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9197,"person_hash":"cw1v2ewn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Posey","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-8","ftm_eid":12998616,"votesmart_id":24280,"opensecrets_id":"N00029662","knowwho_pid":193543,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Posey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR6","sast_bill_id":1137332},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR11","sast_bill_id":1137448},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR22","sast_bill_id":1141992}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1960788,"date":"2019-03-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HJR51\/id\/1960788","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hjres51\/BILLS-116hjres51ih.pdf","text_size":277366,"text_hash":"9e25a52edfbd0ae974b0d7f22bb43e8e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
