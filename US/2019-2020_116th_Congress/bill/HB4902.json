ARPA-Terra must award grants to institutions of higher education and other entities to achieve its goals, including to accelerate early-stage research on agricultural technologies. ARPA-Terra must also implement agriculture technology projects that identify and promote revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences; translate scientific discoveries and cutting-edge inventions into technological innovations; and accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that, due to technical and financial uncertainty, industry is not likely to undertake without federal assistance.","pending_committee_id":3245,"committee":{"committee_id":3245,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-29","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-11-14","committee_id":3245,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20041,"person_hash":"3n1sakj2","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cindy Axne","first_name":"Cindy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Axne","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-3","ftm_eid":44044592,"votesmart_id":179226,"opensecrets_id":"N00041104","knowwho_pid":627442,"ballotpedia":"Cindy_Axne","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB2732","sast_bill_id":1278549}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13130,"subject_name":"Agricultural research"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13658,"subject_name":"Technology transfer and commercialization"},{"subject_id":13612,"subject_name":"Agricultural trade"},{"subject_id":13332,"subject_name":"Atmospheric science and weather"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2060156,"date":"2019-11-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4902\/id\/2060156","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4902\/BILLS-116hr4902ih.pdf","text_size":345794,"text_hash":"1ae079b661e9d65a648db7081a425bcc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
