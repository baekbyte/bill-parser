Specifically, an employee may use such leave if the employee is ordered or recommended to self-quarantine by a government official or health care provider, caring for a family member who has been ordered or recommended to self-quarantine, or caring for the employee's child because the child's school or child-care provider is closed. Public health emergency leave is not available to employees who work an intermittent or reduced work schedule. An employee may substitute available accrued leave for public health emergency leave, but an employer may not require an employee to make such substitution.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9127,"person_hash":"yj5zsql5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Scott","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"Bobby","district":"HD-VA-3","ftm_eid":17658728,"votesmart_id":173269,"opensecrets_id":"N00002147","knowwho_pid":159106,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Scott_(Delaware)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16271,"person_hash":"jlk6q4zn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alma Adams","first_name":"Alma","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-12","ftm_eid":5890773,"votesmart_id":5935,"opensecrets_id":"N00035451","knowwho_pid":196595,"ballotpedia":"Alma_Adams","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15239,"person_hash":"2abxxyrw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Takano","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Takano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-41","ftm_eid":17657771,"votesmart_id":22337,"opensecrets_id":"N00006701","knowwho_pid":378804,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Takano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20078,"person_hash":"3v5vyjqg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzanne Lee","first_name":"Suzanne","middle_name":"Kelley","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"Susie","district":"HD-NV-3","ftm_eid":9713907,"votesmart_id":169344,"opensecrets_id":"N00037247","knowwho_pid":541030,"ballotpedia":"Susie_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6201","sast_bill_id":1359175}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13502,"subject_name":"Employee leave"},{"subject_id":13470,"subject_name":"Family relationships"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175515,"date":"2020-03-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6220\/id\/2175515","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6220\/BILLS-116hr6220ih.pdf","text_size":326593,"text_hash":"9d150a6fe905f94f5f927efab1a473b2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
