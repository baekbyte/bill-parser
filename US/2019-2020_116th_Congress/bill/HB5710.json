Employers must post in the workplace a notice of this prohibition.The bill permits certain noncompete agreements in the context of the sale of a business or the dissolution of a business partnership.Violations of the prohibition against noncompete agreements are unfair business practices subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. The Department of Labor also must receive and investigate complaints of such violations and may bring claims to prohibit enforcement of such noncompete agreements and seek civil penalties.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-29","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15235,"person_hash":"mdfdtnth","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Peters","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-52","ftm_eid":14148706,"votesmart_id":70351,"opensecrets_id":"N00033591","knowwho_pid":378729,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Peters","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18306,"person_hash":"h18j43v2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Gallagher","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gallagher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-8","ftm_eid":40609598,"votesmart_id":171843,"opensecrets_id":"N00039330","knowwho_pid":577549,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Gallagher_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8971,"person_hash":"ksn2rrxb","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anna Eshoo","first_name":"Anna","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Eshoo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-18","ftm_eid":8050793,"votesmart_id":26741,"opensecrets_id":"N00007335","knowwho_pid":158731,"ballotpedia":"Anna_Eshoo","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2614","sast_bill_id":1276983}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13768,"subject_name":"Business ethics"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13551,"subject_name":"Labor-management relations"},{"subject_id":13807,"subject_name":"Trade secrets and economic espionage"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2118223,"date":"2020-02-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5710\/id\/2118223","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5710\/BILLS-116hr5710ih.pdf","text_size":341601,"text_hash":"c02d7b04f9ddcf7ae64ab3ef44af3cf8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
