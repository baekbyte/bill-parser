The bill also requires that the fee for a commercial filming activity or similar project in a unit of the National Park System be sufficient to cover the cost of a film permit and other administrative and personnel costs. Interior and USDA must also assess an annual fee of up to $200 for still photography crews of five persons or fewer. The bill repeals the requirement for collection by Interior and USDA of costs incurred as a result of filming activities or similar projects, including administrative and personnel costs, in addition to the reasonable fee assessed for commercial filming activities or similar projects in a system unit.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-04","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-04-23","committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"},{"date":"2019-04-26","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-23","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-26","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9216,"person_hash":"lkizgzxc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Latta","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Latta","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-5","ftm_eid":3428798,"votesmart_id":9926,"opensecrets_id":"N00012233","knowwho_pid":209172,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Latta","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":654},{"people_id":9213,"person_hash":"86i58pyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Cole","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cole","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-4","ftm_eid":14964187,"votesmart_id":46034,"opensecrets_id":"N00025726","knowwho_pid":211693,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cole_(Oklahoma)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9120,"person_hash":"9bus82xc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tim Ryan","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ryan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-13","ftm_eid":2850732,"votesmart_id":45638,"opensecrets_id":"N00025280","knowwho_pid":208806,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Ryan_(Ohio)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11164,"person_hash":"qvy181au","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Austin Scott","first_name":"Austin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-8","ftm_eid":6805076,"votesmart_id":11812,"opensecrets_id":"N00032457","knowwho_pid":193858,"ballotpedia":"Austin_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":22687,"subject_name":"Forests, forestry, trees"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13257,"subject_name":"Parks, recreation areas, trails"},{"subject_id":13669,"subject_name":"Television and film"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1997023,"date":"2019-04-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2106\/id\/1997023","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2106\/BILLS-116hr2106ih.pdf","text_size":285768,"text_hash":"64a164edfe4b2f2ec9bd83cf781047c7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
