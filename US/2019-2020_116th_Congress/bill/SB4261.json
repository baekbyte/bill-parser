Specifically, the Department of Education (ED) must partner with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to LEAs for certain activities to reopen schools. These activities include (1) purchasing personal protective equipment; (2) cleaning and disinfecting schools; (3) purchasing the supplies necessary to carry out their reopening plans; and (4) complying with the guidelines, recommendations, and other public health communications issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other entities to mitigate the hazards of COVID-19. Additionally, ED and HHS must (1) develop a process to connect health care professionals with schools to assist them with symptom checks and additional supports, and (2) develop recommendations to expand telehealth services to students and teachers in areas with a shortage of health care professionals. Further, HHS must issue guidance to clarify that private health insurance must cover COVID-19 testing, without imposing cost-sharing, through telehealth services in school-based settings. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must issue a letter to advise states on providing coverage for telehealth services in school-based settings under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Finally, ED must develop an online clearinghouse to collect and maintain evidence-based information, including best practices, related to reopening schools after closures due to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-22","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16520,"person_hash":"pw88booc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"David Perdue","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perdue","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":12377537,"votesmart_id":151330,"opensecrets_id":"N00035516","knowwho_pid":474720,"ballotpedia":"David_Perdue","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2203790,"date":"2020-08-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4261\/id\/2203790","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4261\/BILLS-116s4261is.pdf","text_size":308577,"text_hash":"941a082959bb57d70e48a7b98ca987ac"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
