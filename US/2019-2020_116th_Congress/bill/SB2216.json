Specifically, the bill requires the VA to formally recognize caregivers of veterans by identifying any caregiver in the electronic health record of the veteran. Such caregivers covered by the bill include those approved as a provider of personal care services under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and those participating in the Program of General Caregiver Support Services. The bill requires the VA to use standardized letters to notify veterans, their caregivers, and applicants for the program regarding decisions affecting the furnishing of assistance under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. The bill also authorizes the VA to temporarily extend benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, including the monthly personal caregiver stipend, after determining that a veteran is no longer clinically eligible for the program.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-23","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-08-05","action":"Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
