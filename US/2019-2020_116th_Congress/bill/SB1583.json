Specifically, HUD must require owners of such housing to (1) conduct, within specified time frames, risk assessment for lead-based paint hazards; (2) control the hazards; and (3) provide certain notice to residents. If a family with a child younger than age six occupies such housing in which lead-based paint hazards are identified but not controlled, HUD must allow the family to relocate on an emergency basis to another dwelling without any wait, penalty, or lapse in assistance.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
