Specifically, the bill requires the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test a model in which specified opioid treatments and recovery support services are provided under Medicare without cost-sharing (e.g., coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles). The bill also allows state Medicaid programs to cover recovery support services as part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and increases the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage for MAT. Private health insurers must also cover specified opioid treatments and MAT-associated recovery support services without cost-sharing.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-16","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20056,"person_hash":"64vfxa51","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Madeleine Dean","first_name":"Madeleine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dean","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-4","ftm_eid":4701392,"votesmart_id":136484,"opensecrets_id":"N00042894","knowwho_pid":569358,"ballotpedia":"Madeleine_Dean","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1424","sast_bill_id":1260580}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13345,"subject_name":"Drug trafficking and controlled substances"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13623,"subject_name":"Physical fitness and lifestyle"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2203832,"date":"2020-08-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7627\/id\/2203832","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7627\/BILLS-116hr7627ih.pdf","text_size":305910,"text_hash":"8a913934b6fcb8895af7b2fa1622c2d5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
