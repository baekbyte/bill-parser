Steel-jaw leghold traps are certain spring-powered devices with steel jaws that are designed to snap closed on animals. Conibear traps consist of metal frames hinged at the center point and powered by two torsion springs that create a scissor-like action designed to kill an animal by snapping its spine. Cage traps, box traps, suitcase-type live beaver traps, and mouse or rat snap traps are not included in the ban. The bill establishes penalties for violating this ban. The Department of the Interior must pay a reward for information that leads to a conviction of a violation of this bill, unless the information was provided by on duty officers or employees of federal, state, or local governments. The reward must be 50% of the fine paid.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-12-02","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-12-02","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-02","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-02","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-02","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16271,"person_hash":"jlk6q4zn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alma Adams","first_name":"Alma","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-12","ftm_eid":5890773,"votesmart_id":5935,"opensecrets_id":"N00035451","knowwho_pid":196595,"ballotpedia":"Alma_Adams","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9084,"person_hash":"uhhvf8k8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nita Lowey","first_name":"Nita","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Lowey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-17","ftm_eid":4674617,"votesmart_id":26982,"opensecrets_id":"N00001024","knowwho_pid":158987,"ballotpedia":"Nita_Lowey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9233,"person_hash":"3g8ra8ox","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Grace Napolitano","first_name":"Grace","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Napolitano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-32","ftm_eid":774257,"votesmart_id":8393,"opensecrets_id":"N00006789","knowwho_pid":158751,"ballotpedia":"Grace_Napolitano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13481,"subject_name":"Animals"},{"subject_id":13482,"subject_name":"Animal protection and human-animal relationships"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":20695,"subject_name":"Customs enforcement"},{"subject_id":20689,"subject_name":"Hunting and fishing"},{"subject_id":13864,"subject_name":"Legal fees and court costs"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2219464,"date":"2020-12-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8828\/id\/2219464","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8828\/BILLS-116hr8828ih.pdf","text_size":292071,"text_hash":"37aa24d499a02f90614c556a5c3f57cc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
