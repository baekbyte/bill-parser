(That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with specified entities, must annually determine the minimum level of relevant supplies to be maintained in the stockpile and include the expenditures necessary to maintain that level in its budget submission to Congress. If the minimum level of supplies cannot be maintained due to production or other issues, HHS shall request that the President use appropriate authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The bill also (1) permits HHS to transfer supplies from the stockpile to any federal department or agency on a reimbursable basis, subject to certain limitations; and (2) eliminates the cap on the amount of funds that may remain available at the close of a fiscal year to carry out activities related to the supply or production of essential materials and goods. (Under current law, funds in excess of $750 million revert to the general fund).","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
