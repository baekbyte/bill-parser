The Department of the Interior shall enter into a cooperative agreement with New Mexico that specifies, subject to certain prohibition provisions under the Wilderness Act, the terms and conditions under which wildlife management activities in the wilderness may be carried out. Subject to such agreement and such prohibition provisions, Interior may authorize the maintenance of any existing structure or facility for wildlife water development projects (including guzzlers) in the wilderness, if the structure or facility would enhance wilderness values by promoting healthy, viable, and more naturally distributed wildlife populations; and the visual impacts of the structure or facility on the wilderness can reasonably be minimized.","pending_committee_id":2310,"committee":{"committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-09","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8979,"person_hash":"s3k15nh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben Lujan","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"Ray","last_name":"Lujan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-3","ftm_eid":9025644,"votesmart_id":102842,"opensecrets_id":"N00029562","knowwho_pid":266495,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Lujan,_Sr.","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20068,"person_hash":"e1243zkk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debra Haaland","first_name":"Debra","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haaland","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8997515,"votesmart_id":149368,"opensecrets_id":"N00040933","knowwho_pid":491018,"ballotpedia":"Debra_Haaland","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3241","sast_bill_id":1322976}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13410,"subject_name":"Monuments and memorials"},{"subject_id":13563,"subject_name":"New Mexico"},{"subject_id":13257,"subject_name":"Parks, recreation areas, trails"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13301,"subject_name":"Wilderness and natural areas, wildlife refuges, wild rivers, habitats"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213972,"date":"2020-11-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8564\/id\/2213972","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8564\/BILLS-116hr8564ih.pdf","text_size":294889,"text_hash":"195515192419d0d14c9972c2b3ade53b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
