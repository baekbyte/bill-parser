Specifically, states may (1) allow certain families that have incomes of up to 400% of the federal poverty level and that have experienced reduced incomes because of COVID-19 to receive TANF assistance, and (2) provide additional cash payments to these and other TANF recipients. The Department of Health and Human Services must increase state and tribal TANF grants to offset increased expenditures that result from these changes. The bill provides appropriations for this purpose. The bill also suspends TANF work requirements and other conditions during the emergency.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-18","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13383,"subject_name":"Social welfare"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13274,"subject_name":"Separation, divorce, custody, support"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177831,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3522\/id\/2177831","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3522\/BILLS-116s3522is.pdf","text_size":320453,"text_hash":"d0f8b2c409d810c4716f2da6abb85182"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
