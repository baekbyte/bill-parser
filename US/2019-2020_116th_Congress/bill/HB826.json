Examples include dengue, leprosy, and rabies. The bill sets forth certain priorities for the NTDs Program of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), including the coordination of program activities with other USAID development sectors regarding (1) education; (2) food security; and (3) water, sanitation, and hygiene. The bill also directs the Department of State and the President to encourage foreign governments and international entities (e.g., the World Bank Institute) to address NTDs. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must take a series of actions relating to NTDs, including promoting initiatives in international forums and establishing a panel to address worm infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may award grants to support centers of excellence for research, training, and treatment regarding NTDs, including Ebola.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
