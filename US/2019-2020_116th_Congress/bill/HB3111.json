The bill prohibits fraud and false statements in connection with a flood insurance claim under NFIP. Claims under NFIP must be approved or denied no later than 120 days after the claim is made, with provisions for an extension in extraordinary cases. The bill gives FEMA oversight in litigation conducted by Write Your Own companies. (A Write Your Own company writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name.) FEMA may not hire in connection with NFIP any disbarred or suspended attorney. directs FEMA to ensure sufficient staff for the Flood Insurance Advocate, authorizes FEMA to credit reserve funds to the National Flood Insurance Fund, and establishes pilot programs and committees. The Government Accountability Office must report on claims adjustment practices under NFIP and NFIP coverage of earth movement and subsidence.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 58 - 0.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-28","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Financial Services.
