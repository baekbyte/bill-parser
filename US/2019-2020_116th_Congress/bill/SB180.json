Drilling and spacing units are one component of a state regulatory framework for oil and gas exploration and production. The bill retains the right of the federal government to receive royalties from the production of federal minerals within the drilling or spacing unit.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-17","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining.
