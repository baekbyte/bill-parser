Specifically, the bill establishes rules for lenders, servicers, or assignees of postsecondary education loans, including requirements related to (1) the sale, transfer, or assignment of such loans; (2) interest rate and term changes for such loans; (3) payment information required to be included with each billing cycle; and (4) application and allocation of payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) must develop and issue model forms to allow borrowers to compare alternative repayment options, forbearance, and deferment options. The CFPB must also establish a student loan servicing interagency working group, which shall make recommendations for the regulations required under the bill. Further, the CFPB must issue rules to establish standards for the furnishing of information related to student loans to a consumer reporting agency, and any furnisher of such information must comply with such rules. A private educational lender must, in general, obtain a private loan certification from an institution of higher education before consummating any loan with a student attending such institution.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-04","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-10","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-11","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 32 - 26.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16271,"person_hash":"jlk6q4zn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alma Adams","first_name":"Alma","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-12","ftm_eid":5890773,"votesmart_id":5935,"opensecrets_id":"N00035451","knowwho_pid":196595,"ballotpedia":"Alma_Adams","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9023,"person_hash":"6f2n6oig","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Emanuel Cleaver","first_name":"Emanuel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cleaver","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-5","ftm_eid":4396432,"votesmart_id":39507,"opensecrets_id":"N00026790","knowwho_pid":226522,"ballotpedia":"Emanuel_Cleaver","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8957,"person_hash":"0lt6ddgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Frank Pallone","first_name":"Frank","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pallone","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-6","ftm_eid":17658803,"votesmart_id":26951,"opensecrets_id":"N00000781","knowwho_pid":158957,"ballotpedia":"Frank_Pallone","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1354","sast_bill_id":1257365}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20665,"subject_name":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2072291,"date":"2019-12-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5294\/id\/2072291","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5294\/BILLS-116hr5294ih.pdf","text_size":402481,"text_hash":"f9c463cfe986c1b194097cf4aae13e7e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
