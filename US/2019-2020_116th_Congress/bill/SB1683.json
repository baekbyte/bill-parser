The Office of Personnel Management shall establish a pilot program to expand, when necessary, a service year limitation for seasonal or temporary federal employees whose duties primarily involve being a firefighter. The bill allows wildland firefighters of the Forest Service or Interior who sustained injuries in the performance of their duties that prevent them from performing the physical duties of a firefighter, but who commence an equivalent federal position after receiving compensation for their work injuries, to retain the same retirement benefits they would have received in their former position had they not been injured or disabled, without requiring them to complete any more years of service. Compensation for disability or death of Forest Service and Interior wildland firefighters must include overtime pay received for wildfire suppression activity.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14889,"person_hash":"tc69v8nn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Steve Daines","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Daines","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7687176,"votesmart_id":135720,"opensecrets_id":"N00033054","knowwho_pid":378524,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Daines","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13810,"subject_name":"Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":22687,"subject_name":"Forests, forestry, trees"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13899,"subject_name":"Migrant, seasonal, agricultural labor"},{"subject_id":13254,"subject_name":"National and community service"},{"subject_id":13770,"subject_name":"Office of Personnel Management (OPM)"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2034582,"date":"2019-06-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1683\/id\/2034582","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1683\/BILLS-116s1683is.pdf","text_size":377924,"text_hash":"92eaa506ed2a973271632d4e57f9a3c5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
