Specifically, the CMS may extend the pass-through status of drugs and devices that received such status during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) if their cost cannot be accurately calculated due to the effects of COVID-19. The bill's provisions apply to drugs and devices that had pass-through status during any portion of the public health emergency period, including those for which such status has already expired.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
