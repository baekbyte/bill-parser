The bill prohibits specified federal employees and contractors of an agency that funds, conducts, or oversees scientific research from engaging in scientific or research misconduct or manipulating communication of scientific or technical findings. A covered individual may disseminate scientific or technical findings by (1) participating in scientific conferences; and (2) seeking publication through peer-reviewed, professional, or scholarly journals. The bill specifies the kinds of scientific community activities covered individuals may participate and engage in, including the reviewing of public statements and responding to media interview requests. Each covered agency must develop, adopt, and enforce a scientific integrity policy and also must submit it to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Congress; appoint a Scientific Integrity Officer; and adopt and implement an administrative process and administrative appeal for dispute resolution and a training program that, among other things, provides regular scientific integrity and ethics training to employees and contractors. OSTP must collate, organize, and publicly share all information it receives under each scientific integrity policy on its website.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And
