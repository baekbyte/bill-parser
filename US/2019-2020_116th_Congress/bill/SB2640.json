Specifically, the bill makes for-profit institutions of higher education ineligible to receive such assistance. The bill also makes ineligible any institution that has (1) filed for bankruptcy; (2) been convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving federal student aid; (3) committed fraud, substantial misrepresentation, or false certification involving federal student aid; or (4) executive officers who were previously employed at an institution receiving federal student aid that closed. Additionally, the bill establishes certain criteria that an IHE must meet to be eligible for conversion from a for-profit IHE to a nonprofit IHE. Before approving such conversion, the Department of Education must publish the application in the Federal Register for notice and comment.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-17","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4724","sast_bill_id":1277088}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13688,"subject_name":"Area studies and international education"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13534,"subject_name":"Educational technology and distance education"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13240,"subject_name":"Medical education"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"},{"subject_id":13753,"subject_name":"Veterinary medicine and animal diseases"},{"subject_id":81057,"subject_name":"Vocational and technical education"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2058535,"date":"2019-10-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2640\/id\/2058535","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2640\/BILLS-116s2640is.pdf","text_size":354909,"text_hash":"a0d77c1cd76b200173bd7f986dbf2bc9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
