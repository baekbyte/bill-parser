Specifically, the bill provides $50.5 billion for such assistance, of which (1) $35 billion shall be distributed based on the Community Development Block Grant formula (70% allocated to larger cities and counties and 30% to rural communities), (2) $15 billion shall be allocated to provide financing exclusively to businesses in rural areas, and (3) $500 million shall be for Native American Tribes. These amounts shall be used to start or scale a local small business emergency fund or to support organizations that provide technical assistance to small businesses or nonprofits. Such local funds or organizations may then use the amounts to assist small businesses (including sole proprietorships, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals) and nonprofits that (1) employ no more than 20 full-time employees (50 if the recipient is located in a low-income community), (2) has experienced a loss of revenue because of COVID-19, and (3) satisfies any additional requirements imposed by the administrator of the fund.
