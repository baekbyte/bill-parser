The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. The amendment requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber of Congress to levy a new tax, increase the rate of any tax, or increase the debt limit. The amendment provides any Member of Congress with standing and a cause of action to seek judicial enforcement of this amendment if authorized by a petition signed by one-third of the Members of either house of Congress. Courts are prohibited from ordering any increase in revenue to enforce this amendment.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-24","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9484,"person_hash":"1zy2f3m5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chuck Grassley","first_name":"Chuck","middle_name":"","last_name":"Grassley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6338995,"votesmart_id":53293,"opensecrets_id":"N00001758","knowwho_pid":165215,"ballotpedia":"Chuck_Grassley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR6","sast_bill_id":1137332},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR22","sast_bill_id":1141992},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SJR3","sast_bill_id":1138021},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR40","sast_bill_id":1182211}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1873510,"date":"2019-01-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SJR5\/id\/1873510","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/sjres5\/BILLS-116sjres5is.pdf","text_size":245296,"text_hash":"39fc16ab4296e203501b12f8d6788daf"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
