Specifically, as a condition of such a transaction, companies must provide a warrant (i.e., the right to purchase company stock in the future at a specified exercise price) or a senior debt instrument to Treasury. The exercise price for a warrant must be set by Treasury for the primary benefit of taxpayers. Treasury is generally prohibited from purchasing or guaranteeing assets from an inverted domestic corporation (i.e., a domestic corporation that has been restructured to incorporate in a foreign jurisdiction for tax purposes) in response to COVID-19. An entity receiving specified assistance in response to COVID-19 may not claim the trade or business expenses tax deduction for the amount an individual employee is compensated above $500,000.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-18","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9460,"person_hash":"glri16zi","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jack Reed","first_name":"Jack","middle_name":"","last_name":"Reed","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-RI","ftm_eid":5584992,"votesmart_id":27060,"opensecrets_id":"N00000362","knowwho_pid":165269,"ballotpedia":"Jack_Reed","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6379","sast_bill_id":1361588}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13365,"subject_name":"Foreign and international corporations"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13587,"subject_name":"Income tax deferral"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177841,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3526\/id\/2177841","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3526\/BILLS-116s3526is.pdf","text_size":336408,"text_hash":"feec74f68015fb620b59a3f258398f34"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
