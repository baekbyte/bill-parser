A tax that is imposed on the rental of motor vehicles or a motor vehicle rental business is discriminatory if: (1) it is not generally applicable to more than 51% of other rentals of tangible personal property or businesses within a state or locality, or (2) the rate exceeds the generally applicable tax rate on at least 51% of the other rentals of tangible personal property or businesses within the jurisdiction. A tax discriminates against motor vehicle rental property if a state or locality: (1) assesses the property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the property than the ratio applicable to commercial and industrial property, or (2) levies or collects either a tax on an assessment prohibited by this bill or an ad valorem property tax on motor vehicle rental property at a generally applicable rate that exceeds the rate for commercial and industrial property in the jurisdiction. A person who is aggrieved by a discriminatory tax may bring a civil action in a U.S. district court for damages, injunctive relief, other legal or equitable relief, or declaratory relief.","pending_committee_id":4044,"committee":{"committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-12","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-10-02","committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-02","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11045,"person_hash":"u40pl0xx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Chabot","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chabot","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-1","ftm_eid":16571277,"votesmart_id":21790,"opensecrets_id":"N00003689","knowwho_pid":159001,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Chabot","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18327,"person_hash":"ne1btca3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jamie Raskin","first_name":"Jamie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Raskin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-8","ftm_eid":1066956,"votesmart_id":65904,"opensecrets_id":"N00037036","knowwho_pid":248823,"ballotpedia":"Jamie_Raskin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":23053,"subject_name":"Lease and rental services"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":27753,"subject_name":"Property tax"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053590,"date":"2019-09-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4311\/id\/2053590","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4311\/BILLS-116hr4311ih.pdf","text_size":364191,"text_hash":"126325f271b25bb2c0ff2ff34382fbe6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
