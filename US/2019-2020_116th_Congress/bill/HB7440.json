Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system with protections for civil rights such as freedom of speech. This arrangement is enshrined in (1) the Joint Declaration, a 1984 treaty pertaining to the United Kingdom's transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China; and (2) the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitutional document. The Department of State shall report annually to Congress information about (1) foreign individuals and entities that materially contributed to China's failure to comply with the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law; and (2) foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted a significant transaction with such identified individuals and entities. An individual, entity, or financial institution may be excluded from this report for various reasons, such as to protect an intelligence source. The President shall impose property-blocking sanctions on an individual or entity named in a report, and visa-blocking sanctions on a named individual. The President shall impose various sanctions on a financial institution named in a report, such as prohibiting the institution from receiving loans from a U.S. financial institution. The President may waive or terminate the imposition of sanctions under this bill. Congress may override such a waiver or termination by passing a joint resolution of disapproval.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-01","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},{"date":"2020-07-14","committee_id":2629,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Trade"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Committee on Foreign Affairs discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Committee on the Judiciary discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Committee on Financial Services discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Committee on Ways and Means discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Committee on Rules discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Mr. Sherman asked unanimous consent to discharge from committee and consider.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Considered by unanimous consent.
