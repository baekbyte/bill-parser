The bill allows the federal hours-of-service rules exemption regarding maximum driving and on-duty time for drivers transporting agricultural commodities and farm supplies to apply year-round. Current law provides an exception from the federal hours-of-service rules for the transportation of agricultural commodities within a 150 air-mile radius of the normal work reporting location only during planting and harvest periods which are determined by each state. Additionally, the Department of Transportation must issue regulations to amend the definition of agricultural commodity to include specific commodities that are covered by the federal hours-of-service rules exception.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-04","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-06-05","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20076,"person_hash":"yfzzetnh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Joyce","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Joyce","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-13","ftm_eid":44955073,"votesmart_id":178911,"opensecrets_id":"N00043242","knowwho_pid":659206,"ballotpedia":"John_Joyce_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13838,"subject_name":"General agriculture matters"},{"subject_id":13234,"subject_name":"Labor standards"},{"subject_id":13773,"subject_name":"Motor carriers"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2198291,"date":"2020-06-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7102\/id\/2198291","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7102\/BILLS-116hr7102ih.pdf","text_size":305721,"text_hash":"fd49bf12a7ca38efd7a3f00a2aee8241"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
