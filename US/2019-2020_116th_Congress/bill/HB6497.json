This coverage does not apply to losses incurred by an otherwise qualified business if that business involuntarily terminated the health care or the employment of an employee during the national emergency period. An insurer may exclude this additional coverage from a contract for business interruption coverage if the insured agrees in writing, or if the insured fails to pay the corresponding premium increase. is effective only upon certification by the Department of the Treasury that a federal backstop exists to serve as a mechanism to reinsure insurers against excessive losses as a result of these requirements.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial
