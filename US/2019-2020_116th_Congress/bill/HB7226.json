The commission shall review and evaluate the efficiency and public need for each agency or advisory committee at least once every six years; recommend whether each agency or advisory committee should be continued, abolished, or reorganized; and propose legislative language based on its recommendations for abolishing or reorganizing an agency or advisory committee. When the commission is considering whether to recommend continuing, abolishing, or reorganizing an agency or advisory committee, the agency shall submit timely responses to a questionnaire provided by the commission, which shall include an explanation of why the functions of the agency or advisory committee continue to be necessary, what efficiencies taxpayers realize by the continued operation of the agency or advisory committee, and why the responsibilities of the agency or advisory committee cannot be better performed by the private sector or another agency or committee. Legislation proposed by the commission shall be granted expedited consideration.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-15","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20106,"person_hash":"plq6uczb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ross Spano","first_name":"Ross","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-15","ftm_eid":13889263,"votesmart_id":142164,"opensecrets_id":"N00043319","knowwho_pid":425567,"ballotpedia":"Ross_Spano","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19407,"person_hash":"5gfyvsdp","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ralph Norman","first_name":"Ralph","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Norman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-5","ftm_eid":6126950,"votesmart_id":47930,"opensecrets_id":"N00027783","knowwho_pid":227505,"ballotpedia":"Ralph_Norman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3708","sast_bill_id":1365750}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13466,"subject_name":"Congressional operations and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13657,"subject_name":"Congressional-executive branch relations"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13588,"subject_name":"Members of Congress"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199859,"date":"2020-07-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7226\/id\/2199859","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7226\/BILLS-116hr7226ih.pdf","text_size":326668,"text_hash":"4a24c14cb94d448106fda2a06340d267"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
