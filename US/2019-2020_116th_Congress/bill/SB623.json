If Congress is notified, the Department of the Treasury may issue additional debt for the priority obligations in excess of the debt limit. Treasury may issue the additional debt during the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the United States is unable to use revenues or extraordinary measures to fully pay the priority obligations at the time they are due. (The term \"extraordinary measures\" refers to a series of actions that Treasury may implement to allow the United States to borrow additional funds without exceeding the debt limit. The measures generally include suspensions or delays of debt sales and suspensions or redemptions of investments in certain government funds.)","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13382,"subject_name":"Veterans' loans, housing, homeless programs"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1963741,"date":"2019-03-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB623\/id\/1963741","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s623\/BILLS-116s623is.pdf","text_size":155943,"text_hash":"16824f8c89eb8db19d38a50168cf38d6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
