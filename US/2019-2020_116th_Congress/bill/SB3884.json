(Essential critical infrastructure employees include, but are not limited to, medical and health care, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works.) Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DOT must require (1) the owners and operators of equipment or facilities used by passenger or freight transportation employers implement personal protective equipment and disinfection and sanitization procedures; and (2) an air carrier to submit to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) a proposal to permit pilots to wear masks or protective face coverings in the flight deck, including a safety risk assessment with respect to such proposal. The bill sets forth requirements for owners or operators who cannot acquire necessary personal protective equipment due to market unavailability. For the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency, the FAA must (1) provide certain employees, including any air traffic controller and airway transportation systems specialist, with personal protective and sanitizing equipment; (2) ensure that each air traffic control facility is cleaned, disinfected, and sanitized frequently; and (3) ensure its contractors provide their employees with personal protective equipment.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-03","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-03","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9427,"person_hash":"ajo63a1r","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Maria Cantwell","first_name":"Maria","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cantwell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":3465258,"votesmart_id":27122,"opensecrets_id":"N00007836","knowwho_pid":205537,"ballotpedia":"Maria_Cantwell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13360,"subject_name":"Marine and inland water transportation"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13773,"subject_name":"Motor carriers"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199486,"date":"2020-07-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3884\/id\/2199486","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3884\/BILLS-116s3884is.pdf","text_size":318207,"text_hash":"566f4da74e1d5045d498a22b598618dd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
