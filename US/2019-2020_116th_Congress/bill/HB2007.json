In implementing the program, the IRS must (1) ensure that the program complies with applicable security standards and guidelines; and (2) assess and collect a fee for the disclosures at rates that are sufficient to cover the costs related to implementing the program, including the costs of necessary infrastructure or technology.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-01","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-01","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9010,"person_hash":"wwcneni0","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Blumenauer","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-3","ftm_eid":4977792,"votesmart_id":367,"opensecrets_id":"N00007727","knowwho_pid":159028,"ballotpedia":"Earl_Blumenauer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9372,"person_hash":"9q3ib5o9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Patrick McHenry","first_name":"Patrick","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McHenry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-10","ftm_eid":6009425,"votesmart_id":21031,"opensecrets_id":"N00026627","knowwho_pid":212009,"ballotpedia":"Patrick_McHenry","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1957","sast_bill_id":1246602},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB928","sast_bill_id":1246553},{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1100","sast_bill_id":1250744},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3151","sast_bill_id":1267225},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR1053","sast_bill_id":1373780}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1988127,"date":"2019-04-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2007\/id\/1988127","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2007\/BILLS-116hr2007ih.pdf","text_size":153894,"text_hash":"15e3bd2c953247365067591b37433ee2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
