Specifically, the review must be completed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the National Credit Union Administration, in addition to (as required under current law) the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board. The review must be performed at least every 7, rather than 10, years. After performing the review, a regulator must consider tailoring regulations to limit specified burdens. The bill specifies information and criteria the CFPB must use when conducting its review.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-11","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16468,"person_hash":"gs8koi0n","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barry Loudermilk","first_name":"Barry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loudermilk","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-11","ftm_eid":12999116,"votesmart_id":31618,"opensecrets_id":"N00035347","knowwho_pid":228409,"ballotpedia":"Barry_Loudermilk","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18309,"person_hash":"9dqdbujj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Josh Gottheimer","first_name":"Josh","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gottheimer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-5","ftm_eid":39707518,"votesmart_id":169202,"opensecrets_id":"N00036944","knowwho_pid":346665,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Gottheimer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":20665,"subject_name":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13832,"subject_name":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)"},{"subject_id":13636,"subject_name":"Federal Reserve System"},{"subject_id":13791,"subject_name":"National Credit Union Administration"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2039580,"date":"2019-06-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3198\/id\/2039580","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3198\/BILLS-116hr3198ih.pdf","text_size":128581,"text_hash":"e1a6a012b8c35f0e13f996b76e335a60"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
