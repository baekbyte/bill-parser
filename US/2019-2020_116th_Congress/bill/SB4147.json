The following types of entities are eligible for grants: state energy offices; Native American tribes; nonprofit organizations that focus on providing energy efficiency or renewable energy services and receive funding from states, tribes, or utilities; electric cooperative groups; or entities with a public-private partnership under the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The entities that receive grants must then distribute subgrants to certain small- or medium-sized manufacturers (employing no more than 750 employees) located in the same states as the entities. Recipients of subgrants must carry out projects that (1) improve the energy efficiency of the manufacturers, and (2) develop technologies that reduce electricity or natural gas use by the manufacturers. The bill establishes labor requirements for projects that receive grant funding under this bill. In addition, grant projects may only use iron and steel products that are produced in the United States, unless DOE grants a waiver of the requirement.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-01","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB7446","sast_bill_id":1372404}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13140,"subject_name":"Buy American requirements"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13528,"subject_name":"Environmental technology"},{"subject_id":13512,"subject_name":"Industrial facilities"},{"subject_id":13234,"subject_name":"Labor standards"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13785,"subject_name":"Metals"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2201162,"date":"2020-07-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4147\/id\/2201162","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4147\/BILLS-116s4147is.pdf","text_size":326967,"text_hash":"6925f82ec0d4214e1a12c266e6a50b8c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
