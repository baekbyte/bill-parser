Further, this bill prohibits reviewing courts from deferring to an agency's interpretation of a question of law when the authorizing statutory or regulatory provision is silent or ambiguous with respect to an agency's authority. No law may exempt a civil action from the standard of review required by this bill except by specific reference to such provision.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-27","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Read
