Specifically, the bill prohibits the VA from collecting all or any part of an amount owed under a VA program if the amount is owed for any payment or overpayment that was caused by the amount of time taken by the VA to process information provided by or on behalf of an individual. If the VA has made an overpayment to an individual, the VA must provide notice to the individual of the overpayment and any action the VA plans to take to collect repayment or reduce any benefit of the individual at least 90 days before taking such action. The notice must include an explanation of the right of the individual to dispute the overpayment or request a waiver of indebtedness. The VA must report on its plan for the improvement of the notification and communication processes for individuals who receive overpayments from the VA. The bill prohibits interest and administrative cost charges on delinquent payments of debt resulting from a person's participation in a VA disability compensation program, pension program, or an educational assistance program.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-21","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-12-19","committee_id":2631,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-10","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
