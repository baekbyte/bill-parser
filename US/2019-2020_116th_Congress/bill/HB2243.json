The annual fee for a health insurer is currently calculated based on the insurer's share of total premiums from the preceding calendar year. The bill excludes premiums paid by residents of U.S. territories from a health insurer's net premiums but still includes the premiums of such residents in the determination of total premiums from the preceding year, thereby lowering the fee for these insurers. Under current law, the fee is suspended for 2019 (i.e., there is no fee based on premiums from 2018).","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-10","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-04-11","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18411,"person_hash":"k3rdw8m0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon","first_name":"Jenniffer","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gonzalez-Colon","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PR","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":47514,"opensecrets_id":"N00037615","knowwho_pid":221612,"ballotpedia":"Jenniffer_Gonz%C3%A1lez-Col%C3%B3n","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16824,"person_hash":"le3tseyc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Stacey Plaskett","first_name":"Stacey","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Plaskett","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VI","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":155929,"opensecrets_id":"N00035000","knowwho_pid":439826,"ballotpedia":"Stacey_Plaskett","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":17510,"person_hash":"xk8jisyh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Amata Radewagen","first_name":"Amata","middle_name":"Coleman","last_name":"Radewagen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AS","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":128380,"opensecrets_id":"N00007635","knowwho_pid":439739,"ballotpedia":"Aumua_Amata_Radewagen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
