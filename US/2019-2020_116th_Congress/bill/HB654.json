The tax credit is equal to the sum of (1) 40% of the increase for high-demand occupation training expenses, and (2) 20% of the increase for low-demand occupation training expenses. The expenses must be for full-time employees whose compensation does not exceed $82,000 for the year. A \"high-demand occupation training expense\" is designed to lead to employment in an occupation that is expected to experience not fewer than 20% occupational openings over a specified 10-year period.
