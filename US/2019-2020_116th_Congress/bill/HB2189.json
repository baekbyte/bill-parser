NOAA may enter into financial agreements and collect fees to carry out the program; enter into contracts with private sector entities as necessary to collect, process, and provide remote sensing and other geospatial data and products; and establish public tools that are capable of tracking ocean and Great Lakes economy data for each coastal state.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-04-23","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-23","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-08","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Unanimous Consent.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-26","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources.
