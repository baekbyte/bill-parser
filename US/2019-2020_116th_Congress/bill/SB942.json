Only the Federal Election Commission (FEC) must be notified, instead of the FEC and others. Any amount transferred by a joint fundraising committee established by a candidate's authorized committee to any other authorized committee of that candidate shall be treated as a contribution.","pending_committee_id":2331,"committee":{"committee_id":2331,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Rules And Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2331,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Rules And Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15348,"person_hash":"ov53d9s8","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Angus King","first_name":"Angus","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"King","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":1792907,"votesmart_id":22381,"opensecrets_id":"N00034580","knowwho_pid":209655,"ballotpedia":"Angus_King","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB429","sast_bill_id":1147602}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13432,"subject_name":"Congressional elections"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1990541,"date":"2019-04-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB942\/id\/1990541","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s942\/BILLS-116s942is.pdf","text_size":276291,"text_hash":"35e3583e02626ab405e43a8a7cc7d2b5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
