The report shall detail whether such educational materials include content that could be seen as encouraging violence and intolerance toward religious groups, including Muslims who hold dissenting views. The report shall also discuss related subjects, including the extent such materials are exported and efforts by the Saudi government to remove the intolerant content. The State Department shall issue such reports for 10 years, unless the State Department determines that the intolerant content has been completely removed. If such content is still included in Saudi Arabia's educational materials after 10 years, the State Department shall continue reporting to Congress for another 5 years.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-06","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB554","sast_bill_id":1153749}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13894,"subject_name":"Books and print media"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13402,"subject_name":"Human rights"},{"subject_id":13448,"subject_name":"Middle East"},{"subject_id":13890,"subject_name":"Political movements and philosophies"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13462,"subject_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13431,"subject_name":"Terrorism"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1925473,"date":"2019-02-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB357\/id\/1925473","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s357\/BILLS-116s357is.pdf","text_size":160338,"text_hash":"65d4bd6fdd59c3c9411d11555a57bb98"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
