The bill specifies that a plan may not make determinations about the circumstances surrounding individuals' tests, such as why they sought testing or whether they showed symptoms of COVID-19. The bill also specifies that plans may encourage individuals to obtain tests from lower priced providers as long as such efforts do not delay, or impede access to, testing.The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to survey and report on the cash prices of testing services and the compliance of providers with the requirement to publish such prices. Additionally, HHS, jointly with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor, must issue guidance clarifying the process for submitting claims for testing services.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-29","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, and Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20059,"person_hash":"xs2edxvf","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Fletcher","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"Pannill","last_name":"Fletcher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-7","ftm_eid":44045104,"votesmart_id":177031,"opensecrets_id":"N00041194","knowwho_pid":625330,"ballotpedia":"Lizzie_Pannill_Fletcher","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4745","sast_bill_id":1379373}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213483,"date":"2020-10-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8419\/id\/2213483","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8419\/BILLS-116hr8419ih.pdf","text_size":294601,"text_hash":"90042ba913d46f5d0dea5d81cabf7229"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
