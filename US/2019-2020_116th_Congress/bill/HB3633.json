Currently, to be eligible for certain SBA programs, a woman or minority business owner must own an unconditional majority (at least 51%) of their business. However, the bill allows a woman- or minority-owned small business to maintain its contracting eligibility in the event a venture capital or private equity firm purchases an ownership stake in the business, so long as the purchasing enterprise is also owned by either a woman or minority.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-09","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16022,"person_hash":"qfvt1amx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robin Kelly","first_name":"Robin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-2","ftm_eid":2665398,"votesmart_id":33384,"opensecrets_id":"N00035215","knowwho_pid":212680,"ballotpedia":"Robin_Kelly","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14082,"person_hash":"7db3fndh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joyce Beatty","first_name":"Joyce","middle_name":"","last_name":"Beatty","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-3","ftm_eid":2954872,"votesmart_id":2427,"opensecrets_id":"N00033904","knowwho_pid":197852,"ballotpedia":"Joyce_Beatty","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1981","sast_bill_id":1270468}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13275,"subject_name":"Small Business Administration"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13703,"subject_name":"Women in business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2046484,"date":"2019-07-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3633\/id\/2046484","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3633\/BILLS-116hr3633ih.pdf","text_size":366517,"text_hash":"1c7538eea539049ffd807cc43a39cc0b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
