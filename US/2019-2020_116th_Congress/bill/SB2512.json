The bill requires the Department of Labor to develop guidance for economists to develop future earnings tables that do not rely on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or actual or perceived sexual orientation. Additionally, Labor and the Department of Justice must develop guidance for states on how to calculate future earnings in state tort proceedings in a manner that is free of such biases. The Judicial Conference of the United States must report on damages awarded under federal law for personal injury, employment discrimination, tort damages, and cases involving protected classes of individuals sharing a common characteristic or identity who are legally protected against discrimination. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must submit recommendations to ensure that future earnings calculations that take into account age and disability do not conflict with federal equal protection laws. The bill requires the Federal Judicial Center to train federal judges on how to implement this bill.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-19","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4418","sast_bill_id":1275157}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13321,"subject_name":"Civil rights and liberties, minority issues"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13627,"subject_name":"Economic theory"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13326,"subject_name":"Sex, gender, sexual orientation discrimination"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2055056,"date":"2019-09-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2512\/id\/2055056","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2512\/BILLS-116s2512is.pdf","text_size":351090,"text_hash":"d832f5bc1aa9a504a3f6d28c2d4ff29c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
