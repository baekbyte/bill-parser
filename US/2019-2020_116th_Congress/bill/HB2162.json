Under current law, the maximum premium amount for such homebuyers is 2.75% of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage (compared to 3% for other homebuyers). The bill instead requires that the premium amount for such homebuyers be 25 basis points (0.25% of the original insured principal obligation of mortgage) lower than the amount otherwise established by the FHA. The bill also specifies that first-time homebuyers must complete the financial-management counseling program prior to applying for a mortgage or entering into a sales agreement.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},{"date":"2019-07-10","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 53 - 6.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Ms. Waters moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
