Such standards must prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and require, among other things, the technology to be reliable and accurate and easily maintained. DOT must withhold specified graduated percentages of a state's apportionment of federal-aid highway funds for FY2022-FY2024 (5% in each fiscal year thereafter) if the state has not enacted and is not enforcing certain laws to prevent repeat intoxicated driving. A state must require the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-05-24","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16491,"person_hash":"ypi61hrv","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kathleen Rice","first_name":"Kathleen","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Rice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-4","ftm_eid":6510977,"votesmart_id":127653,"opensecrets_id":"N00035927","knowwho_pid":489426,"ballotpedia":"Kathleen_Rice","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2998","sast_bill_id":1264564}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2035917,"date":"2019-06-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3011\/id\/2035917","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3011\/BILLS-116hr3011ih.pdf","text_size":254148,"text_hash":"39ec120059d8138f8587a89d85da16f9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
