A pistol is capable of microstamping ammunition if (1) the characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistol are etched into the breech face and firing pin of the pistol; and (2) these characters are copied onto the cartridge case of the ammunition when the pistol fires such ammunition. Specifically, the bill prohibits a federal firearms licensee (e.g., a gun dealer) from manufacturing, importing, or transferring a semiautomatic pistol that is not capable of microstamping ammunition. Violators are subject to fines. The bill also makes it unlawful for any person to remove, obliterate, or alter the microstamped code or microstamping capability of a firearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Violators are subject to fines and suspension or revocation of any firearms license.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-23","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-03-04","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18293,"person_hash":"vidnqcls","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brown","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-4","ftm_eid":5017996,"votesmart_id":19344,"opensecrets_id":"N00036999","knowwho_pid":195317,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16271,"person_hash":"jlk6q4zn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alma Adams","first_name":"Alma","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-12","ftm_eid":5890773,"votesmart_id":5935,"opensecrets_id":"N00035451","knowwho_pid":196595,"ballotpedia":"Alma_Adams","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
