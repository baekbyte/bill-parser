Specifically, it requires CBO's estimates to include (1) costs to state, local, or tribal governments to implement proposed changes of the conditions for participating in a federal assistance program, upon the request of certain Members of Congress; (2) indirect costs to the private sector, such as foregone profits and costs passed onto consumers and other entities; and (3) costs of rules issued by independent regulatory agencies, except the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. In addition, the bill prohibits consideration of legislation that would increase the direct cost of private sector mandates beyond certain limits, unless such prohibition is waived by Congress. The bill further revises the federal regulatory process by, among other things (1) transferring certain responsibilities from the Office of Management and Budget to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, (2) establishing criteria to guide agencies in assessing the effects of federal regulatory actions, (3) revising requirements for agency statements accompanying significant regulatory actions, (4) requiring agencies to develop a process for private sector parties to provide input on regulatory proposals containing significant federal mandates, and (5) requiring agencies to conduct a retrospective analysis of an existing regulation upon the request of certain Members of Congress.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-12","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15315,"person_hash":"gjw81slg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Deb Fischer","first_name":"Deb","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fischer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NE","ftm_eid":13012823,"votesmart_id":41963,"opensecrets_id":"N00033443","knowwho_pid":228296,"ballotpedia":"Deb_Fischer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11061,"person_hash":"r3ltpj5e","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Lankford","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lankford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-5","ftm_eid":17657561,"votesmart_id":124938,"opensecrets_id":"N00031129","knowwho_pid":284972,"ballotpedia":"James_Lankford","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB300","sast_bill_id":1142070}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13418,"subject_name":"Judicial review and appeals"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13679,"subject_name":"Office of Management and Budget (OMB)"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2189977,"date":"2020-06-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3689\/id\/2189977","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3689\/BILLS-116s3689is.pdf","text_size":333197,"text_hash":"072b31ca9f387bedd93e2f9a220b79e0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
