The bill also makes several additional changes relating to public health, including raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-19","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-26","action":"Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
