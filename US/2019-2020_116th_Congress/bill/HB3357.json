Specifically, the bill requires the board to establish and collect a filing fee to be paid by any individual filing a claim or appeal. The bill requires the board to make a decision in a matter after receiving the written representations of the parties and after an opportunity for a hearing, and the bill authorizes the board to grant a motion for summary judgment. With respect to an appeal from a performance or conduct-based adverse action, the bill prohibits the board from mitigating the personnel action unless it is so disproportionate as to be without justification. Further, the bill requires that all decisions of the agency be supported by substantial evidence. In addition, the bill limits furlough appeals and provides for the reappointment of board members (currently, board members may not be reappointed). The bill also makes the board the arbiter of appeals involving the removal, demotion, or suspension of an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs.","pending_committee_id":2631,"committee":{"committee_id":2631,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-19","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},{"date":"2019-07-16","committee_id":2631,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16462,"person_hash":"49jytvn6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jody Hice","first_name":"Jody","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Hice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-10","ftm_eid":6805581,"votesmart_id":122246,"opensecrets_id":"N00032243","knowwho_pid":286516,"ballotpedia":"Jody_Hice","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16468,"person_hash":"gs8koi0n","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barry Loudermilk","first_name":"Barry","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loudermilk","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-11","ftm_eid":12999116,"votesmart_id":31618,"opensecrets_id":"N00035347","knowwho_pid":228409,"ballotpedia":"Barry_Loudermilk","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14909,"person_hash":"yggb6yb5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Rice","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-7","ftm_eid":17658351,"votesmart_id":11763,"opensecrets_id":"N00033832","knowwho_pid":392043,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Rice_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13163,"subject_name":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13893,"subject_name":"Merit Systems Protection Board"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2043454,"date":"2019-06-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3357\/id\/2043454","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3357\/BILLS-116hr3357ih.pdf","text_size":374304,"text_hash":"eeb61efe70b41885fa19e10891c8b441"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
