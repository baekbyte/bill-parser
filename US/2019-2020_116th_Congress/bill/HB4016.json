Portable benefits are work-related benefits that are provided to workers who are not traditional full-time employees in a manner that allows the worker to maintain the benefits upon changing jobs. The grants must be used for (1) the evaluation, or improvement to the design or implementation, of existing models or approaches for providing portable benefits; or (2) the design, implementation, and evaluation of new models or approaches for providing such benefits. The grants may not be used for a model or approach that provides only retirement-related benefits. The Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report to Congress on the outcome of the grants awarded pursuant to this bill.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14090,"person_hash":"asdkm81r","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzan DelBene","first_name":"Suzan","middle_name":"","last_name":"DelBene","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-1","ftm_eid":2610675,"votesmart_id":126272,"opensecrets_id":"N00030693","knowwho_pid":284676,"ballotpedia":"Suzan_DelBene","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16498,"person_hash":"etwlc6gj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Seth Moulton","first_name":"Seth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moulton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-6","ftm_eid":25004670,"votesmart_id":146299,"opensecrets_id":"N00035431","knowwho_pid":464944,"ballotpedia":"Seth_Moulton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9059,"person_hash":"2l42ff6o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Himes","first_name":"James","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Himes","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-4","ftm_eid":14257522,"votesmart_id":106744,"opensecrets_id":"N00029070","knowwho_pid":266938,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Himes","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15235,"person_hash":"mdfdtnth","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Peters","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-52","ftm_eid":14148706,"votesmart_id":70351,"opensecrets_id":"N00033591","knowwho_pid":378729,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Peters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8972,"person_hash":"iojagoko","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Foster","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foster","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-11","ftm_eid":16623751,"votesmart_id":101632,"opensecrets_id":"N00029139","knowwho_pid":263138,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Foster","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20105,"person_hash":"pj9a15df","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abigail Spanberger","first_name":"Abigail","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spanberger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-7","ftm_eid":44045205,"votesmart_id":179682,"opensecrets_id":"N00041418","knowwho_pid":630216,"ballotpedia":"Abigail_Spanberger","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20111,"person_hash":"lr9fsdh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Haley Stevens","first_name":"Haley","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stevens","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-11","ftm_eid":44044764,"votesmart_id":181092,"opensecrets_id":"N00040915","knowwho_pid":623571,"ballotpedia":"Haley_Stevens","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB541","sast_bill_id":1217769}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048865,"date":"2019-08-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4016\/id\/2048865","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4016\/BILLS-116hr4016ih.pdf","text_size":243139,"text_hash":"e93980fd00db04c5cd2b14d285b127cb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
