Specifically, regulations must be revised based on results from the National Center for Environmental Assessment report titled \u201cEvaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide.\u201d The bill also requires revisions to apply maximum achievable control technology requirements to chamber exhaust vents. Maximum achievable control technology standards are established for sources of hazardous air pollutants to limit or control emissions. The EPA must notify the public of violations under the revised standards, and failure to do so will result in an investigation to assess the health risks and prevent a future failure of notification.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-12","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-26","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
