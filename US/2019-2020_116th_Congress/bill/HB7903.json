Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for the Community Advantage Pilot Program (CA) and includes women and minorities as eligible groups for CA loans in addition to the other categories that are currently eligible. The bill requires at least 75% of loans made by a covered institution under the program be made to small business concerns in underserved markets, and it allows the SBA to waive the $250,000 cap on loan sizes up to $350,000. The bill further requires the SBA to provide both in-person and online training and technical assistance that is free or low-cost for covered institutions making loans under the program. The SBA must establish a working group to develop recommendations for the SBA to effectively manage, support, and promote the program and its mission. Lastly, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on program outcomes.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-31","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},{"date":"2020-12-07","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Ms. Velazquez moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
