The bill designates the funds as an emergency requirement and provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the funds. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.) HHS may use the funds provided by this bill to acquire products such as drugs, vaccines and other biological products, and medical devices for deposit into the Strategic National Stockpile. The bill also exempts the Public Health Emergency Fund from sequestration, which is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.","pending_committee_id":2298,"committee":{"committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-30","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and in addition to the Committee on the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-30","action":"Referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and in addition to the Committee on the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9035,"person_hash":"g25cpbse","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rosa DeLauro","first_name":"Rosa","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"DeLauro","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-3","ftm_eid":5349073,"votesmart_id":26788,"opensecrets_id":"N00000615","knowwho_pid":158778,"ballotpedia":"Rosa_DeLauro","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20117,"person_hash":"k70n0p91","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Trone","first_name":"David","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Trone","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-6","ftm_eid":5631712,"votesmart_id":167336,"opensecrets_id":"N00039122","knowwho_pid":568351,"ballotpedia":"David_Trone","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13945,"subject_name":"Strategic materials and reserves"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2118213,"date":"2020-02-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5723\/id\/2118213","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5723\/BILLS-116hr5723ih.pdf","text_size":320915,"text_hash":"68cb28e12881015539967dbfb1d9d86a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
