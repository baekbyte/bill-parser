Specifically, this bill requires each federal agency to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop an implementation strategy for the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies at or for federally owned and operated facilities. DOE must (1) maintain a data center energy practitioner program that leads to the certification of energy practitioners qualified to evaluate the energy usage and efficiency opportunities in federally owned and operated data centers; and (2) establish an open data initiative to make information about federal data center energy usage available and accessible in a manner that encourages data center innovation, optimization, and consolidation.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-01","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},{"date":"2019-09-10","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-01","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Mr. Rush moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
