FISA warrants shall only be for items specifically identified in the FBI's application to access the records.

The application for such a warrant is ex parte before courts designated under FISA, meaning that the government is the only party present in the proceedings.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9491,"person_hash":"isieh7x3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lisa Murkowski","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murkowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":6604204,"votesmart_id":15841,"opensecrets_id":"N00026050","knowwho_pid":192554,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Murkowski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1942","sast_bill_id":1246530},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5675","sast_bill_id":1319955},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3242","sast_bill_id":1322951}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"},{"subject_id":13431,"subject_name":"Terrorism"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1989442,"date":"2019-04-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB936\/id\/1989442","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s936\/BILLS-116s936is.pdf","text_size":277442,"text_hash":"4001bf39748684d11e547c98227cfca0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
