Specifically, the bill suspends (1) community service requirements, (2) any work requirement or time limitation established in connection with the Moving to Work demonstration program, (3) the minimum rental amount families are required to pay, and (4) the requirement that a family not be absent from a unit for more than 180 consecutive calendar days. These suspensions last until six months after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency period. Additionally, during the COVID-19 public health emergency period, and for 60 days thereafter, public housing agencies may not terminate available low-income housing choice vouchers for the failure to enter into a lease.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-12","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9023,"person_hash":"6f2n6oig","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Emanuel Cleaver","first_name":"Emanuel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cleaver","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-5","ftm_eid":4396432,"votesmart_id":39507,"opensecrets_id":"N00026790","knowwho_pid":226522,"ballotpedia":"Emanuel_Cleaver","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9144,"person_hash":"ijja8k71","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Maxine Waters","first_name":"Maxine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-43","ftm_eid":1257359,"votesmart_id":26759,"opensecrets_id":"N00006690","knowwho_pid":158752,"ballotpedia":"Maxine_Waters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6321","sast_bill_id":1361595},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6326","sast_bill_id":1361617},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6379","sast_bill_id":1361588}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13375,"subject_name":"Housing and community development"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13158,"subject_name":"Department of Housing and Urban Development"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13254,"subject_name":"National and community service"},{"subject_id":13261,"subject_name":"Public housing"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2189827,"date":"2020-06-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6806\/id\/2189827","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6806\/BILLS-116hr6806ih.pdf","text_size":311752,"text_hash":"bf5dc044fe7dddf2c6e9488d1d793628"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
