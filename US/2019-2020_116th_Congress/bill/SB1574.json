The disclosure must set forth the lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued with respect to the participant or beneficiary. The \"lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued\" is the amount of monthly payments the participant or beneficiary would receive if the total accrued benefits were used to provide lifetime income streams based on certain assumptions, including that the participant or beneficiary has a spouse of equal age and a single life annuity. The Department of Labor must issue a model lifetime income disclosure, assumptions that plan administrators may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents, and related rules. No plan fiduciary, sponsor, or other person may be liable under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) solely due to the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents derived in accordance with the assumptions and related rules issued by Labor, including explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9450,"person_hash":"i6e8frel","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Johnny Isakson","first_name":"Johnny","middle_name":"","last_name":"Isakson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":7238922,"votesmart_id":1721,"opensecrets_id":"N00002593","knowwho_pid":158812,"ballotpedia":"Johnny_Isakson","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8986,"person_hash":"m2pvngcc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Murphy","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Murphy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":6384200,"votesmart_id":17189,"opensecrets_id":"N00027566","knowwho_pid":193324,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1007","sast_bill_id":1194223},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1084","sast_bill_id":1196880},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1994","sast_bill_id":1247246},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2367","sast_bill_id":1254656},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB972","sast_bill_id":1247539},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1865","sast_bill_id":1244471}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2033044,"date":"2019-06-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1574\/id\/2033044","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1574\/BILLS-116s1574is.pdf","text_size":250592,"text_hash":"2d7b5ea081eee7c05070e21e2904d037"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
