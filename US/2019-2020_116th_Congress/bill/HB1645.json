Specifically, the bill establishes new offenses for unlawfully reentering and subsequently committing an act that results in injury to or death of another person. A violator is subject to a 10- or 20-year mandatory minimum prison term. Additionally, with respect to a defendant convicted of any illegal reentry offense, the bill prohibits the concurrent service of the federal sentence with a state sentence, and the reduction of the federal sentence by the amount of time spent in state prison.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and
