The bill increases the limit to $15,000 (twice the amount in the case of a joint return) and requires the new limit to be adjusted for inflation after 2019. The bill also increases the income tax rate for corporations to an amount that the Department of the Treasury determines is required to cover the reduction in revenue resulting from the increased tax deduction allowed by this bill.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1757","sast_bill_id":1239728},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2762","sast_bill_id":1278763}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":27753,"subject_name":"Property tax"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2035158,"date":"2019-06-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2894\/id\/2035158","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2894\/BILLS-116hr2894ih.pdf","text_size":362684,"text_hash":"d30b72f282d76f4efcdd46dc5645c0af"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
