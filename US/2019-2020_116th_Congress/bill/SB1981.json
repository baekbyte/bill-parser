Currently, to be eligible for certain SBA programs, a woman or minority business owner must own an unconditional majority (at least 51%) of their business. However, the bill allows a woman- or minority-owned small business to maintain its contracting eligibility in the event a venture capital or private equity firm purchases an ownership stake in the business, so long as the purchasing enterprise is also owned by either a woman or minority.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-26","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-26","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9427,"person_hash":"ajo63a1r","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Maria Cantwell","first_name":"Maria","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cantwell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":3465258,"votesmart_id":27122,"opensecrets_id":"N00007836","knowwho_pid":205537,"ballotpedia":"Maria_Cantwell","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3633","sast_bill_id":1271160}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13275,"subject_name":"Small Business Administration"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13703,"subject_name":"Women in business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2045140,"date":"2019-07-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1981\/id\/2045140","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1981\/BILLS-116s1981is.pdf","text_size":366562,"text_hash":"4b232d299d8c2b895508edf82a8c2472"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
