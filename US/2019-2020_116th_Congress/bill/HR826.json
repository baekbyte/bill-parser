On January 30, 2020, the CMS issued guidance allowing states to apply for capped block grants through Medicaid demonstration waivers, particularly in order to cover services for the Medicaid expansion population (i.e., adults under the age of 65). The guidance also allows states that receive such block grants to make other changes to their programs (e.g., formularies for prescription drugs).","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-03","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-05","action":"Rules Committee Resolution H.
