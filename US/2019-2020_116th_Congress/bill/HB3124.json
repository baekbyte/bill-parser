The bill requires certain disclosures from a foreign issuer of securities that uses, for its required audit report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a foreign public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. If an issuer uses such a foreign public accounting firm, the issuer is generally prohibited from listing its securities on a national securities exchange. Specifically, an issuer that is not currently listed on an exchange and uses such a firm may not be listed. A currently-listed issuer will be delisted beginning in 2025 if the issuer uses such a firm for three consecutive years.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9177,"person_hash":"tryqw5x1","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Conaway","first_name":"K.
