The bill repeals the alternative minimum tax exemption and the increased estate and gift tax exemption and uses the tax revenue to increase need-based federal student aid. Specifically, the bill increases (1) the maximum amount of the federal Pell Grant, and (2) the income threshold that triggers an automatic zero for an expected family contribution. In addition, the bill eliminates Pell Grant funding for an institution of higher education in a state that does not maintain its funding levels for IHEs. Finally, an IHE must disclose performance indicators (e.g., graduation rates and employment outcomes).","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-11","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18295,"person_hash":"h6wxpim8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Salud Carbajal","first_name":"Salud","middle_name":"O.","last_name":"Carbajal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-24","ftm_eid":39707235,"votesmart_id":81569,"opensecrets_id":"N00037015","knowwho_pid":460424,"ballotpedia":"Salud_Carbajal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB2471","sast_bill_id":1274448}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2057217,"date":"2019-10-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4638\/id\/2057217","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4638\/BILLS-116hr4638ih.pdf","text_size":363905,"text_hash":"54b4d9b884cd6fcf6b69f742d41262e3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
