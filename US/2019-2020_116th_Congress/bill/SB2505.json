Specifically, the bill nullifies Executive Order 13783 titled Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth. In addition, the bill nullifies the following rules: the Repeal of the Clean Power Plan; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Electric Utility Generating Units; Revisions to Emission Guidelines Implementing Regulations rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation; Delay and Suspension of Certain Requirements rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management; the Energy Conservation Program: Definition for General Service Lamps rule issued by the Department of Energy (DOE); and the Adopting Requirements in Emission Guidelines for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills rule issued by the EPA. The bill prohibits agencies from finalizing the following proposed rules: the Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review proposed rule issued by the EPA; the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicle Rules for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks proposed rule issued by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Incandescent Lamps proposed determination issued by DOE. Finally, the bill nullifies a rescission of a waiver granted to California to enforce standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, for air pollution emissions from vehicles.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural
