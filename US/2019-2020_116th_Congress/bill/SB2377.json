Specifically, the bill requires state Medicaid programs to verify the assets of all Medicaid applicants and recipients for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility, rather than only of applicants or recipients who are aged, blind, or disabled. The bill also requires U.S. territories to implement asset verification programs. Such requirements must be fully implemented by FY2024. The bill also requires state Medicaid programs to apply a resource eligibility test whenever an income eligibility determination is required, based on resource limitations under the Supplemental Security Income program (currently, states are prohibited from using resource tests).","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-31","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-31","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9478,"person_hash":"zsyqtkoo","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Inhofe","first_name":"James","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Inhofe","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OK","ftm_eid":10938141,"votesmart_id":27027,"opensecrets_id":"N00005582","knowwho_pid":165264,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Inhofe","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16520,"person_hash":"pw88booc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"David Perdue","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perdue","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":12377537,"votesmart_id":151330,"opensecrets_id":"N00035516","knowwho_pid":474720,"ballotpedia":"David_Perdue","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20294,"person_hash":"1lllgwva","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Braun","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Braun","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":21084493,"votesmart_id":148564,"opensecrets_id":"N00041731","knowwho_pid":484213,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Braun","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18413,"person_hash":"i8432eqr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Kennedy","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kennedy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-LA","ftm_eid":13010864,"votesmart_id":35496,"opensecrets_id":"N00026823","knowwho_pid":240389,"ballotpedia":"John_Neely_Kennedy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11061,"person_hash":"r3ltpj5e","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Lankford","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lankford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-5","ftm_eid":17657561,"votesmart_id":124938,"opensecrets_id":"N00031129","knowwho_pid":284972,"ballotpedia":"James_Lankford","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049023,"date":"2019-08-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2377\/id\/2049023","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2377\/BILLS-116s2377is.pdf","text_size":361211,"text_hash":"0eb6d1a4252059df4e9674abafcb9a9d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
