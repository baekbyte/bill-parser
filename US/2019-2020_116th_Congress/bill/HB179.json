The department concerned must offer for sale an equal number of acres of federal land that is under the same jurisdictional status. The bill exempts from this requirement any easements acquired to facilitate management of federal lands. Land sold pursuant to this bill shall be offered for sale at fair market value (based on local comparable sales), with monthly price reductions if the land is not sold in six months. All net proceeds from the sale of federal lands pursuant to this bill shall be deposited directly into the Treasury for reduction of the public debt.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"},{"date":"2019-02-08","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Agriculture, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
