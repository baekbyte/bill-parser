The bill defines low-vision device to mean a physician-prescribed device that magnifies, enhances, or otherwise augments or interprets visual images; the term does not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. The bill appropriates $2.5 million for FY2020 and each of the next four fiscal years for the CMS to carry out the project.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
