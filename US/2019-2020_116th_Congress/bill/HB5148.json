Specifically, states must (1) evaluate each IHE to determine if it meets standards for facilities, equipment, program length, and other relevant factors for a student to receive a professional license from the state; (2) accept and report student complaints that present consistent allegations with respect to an IHE; and (3) establish policies and procedures to anticipate and respond to the closure of an IHE. Such policies and procedures shall include maintaining sufficient cash reserves to ensure the repayment of any required refunds, a plan to ensure custodial record-keeping of institutional records and student transcripts, and the maintenance of contact information to ensure direct communication between the state and each student in the event of an IHE closure.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-18","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20081,"person_hash":"cn1wguew","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Levin","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Levin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-49","ftm_eid":44044456,"votesmart_id":179416,"opensecrets_id":"N00040667","knowwho_pid":617967,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Levin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14882,"person_hash":"y7ptrsug","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Julia Brownley","first_name":"Julia","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brownley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-26","ftm_eid":1256839,"votesmart_id":59904,"opensecrets_id":"N00034254","knowwho_pid":248455,"ballotpedia":"Julia_Brownley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20052,"person_hash":"lmg91h6p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gil Cisneros","first_name":"Gil","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cisneros","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-39","ftm_eid":17779260,"votesmart_id":179370,"opensecrets_id":"N00041464","knowwho_pid":631203,"ballotpedia":"Gil_Cisneros","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4674","sast_bill_id":1276853}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13172,"subject_name":"Educational facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13534,"subject_name":"Educational technology and distance education"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":81062,"subject_name":"Student records"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2071228,"date":"2019-11-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5148\/id\/2071228","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5148\/BILLS-116hr5148ih.pdf","text_size":326806,"text_hash":"7ce98d504afc79e5e57c4296d73a75bb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
