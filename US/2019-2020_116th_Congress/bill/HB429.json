The bill applies this requirement to (1) any political committee, not just a candidate's principal campaign committee; and (2) cumulative contributions of $1,000 or more during a calendar year, instead of only single contributions. Only the Federal Election Commission (FEC) must be notified, instead of the FEC and others. Any amount transferred by a joint fundraising committee established by a candidate's authorized committee to any other authorized committee of that candidate shall be treated as a contribution.","pending_committee_id":2307,"committee":{"committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-10","committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14916,"person_hash":"mw71sc7y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bradley Schneider","first_name":"Bradley","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Schneider","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-10","ftm_eid":2671149,"votesmart_id":134948,"opensecrets_id":"N00033101","knowwho_pid":378769,"ballotpedia":"Brad_Schneider","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9010,"person_hash":"wwcneni0","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Blumenauer","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-3","ftm_eid":4977792,"votesmart_id":367,"opensecrets_id":"N00007727","knowwho_pid":159028,"ballotpedia":"Earl_Blumenauer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB942","sast_bill_id":1246560}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13432,"subject_name":"Congressional elections"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1874340,"date":"2019-01-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB429\/id\/1874340","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr429\/BILLS-116hr429ih.pdf","text_size":246556,"text_hash":"030b39528ecf81c97e8a5e895b33a27f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
