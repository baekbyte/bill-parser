(Mental health parity laws prohibit health insurance plans that cover mental health and substance use disorder services from imposing less favorable limitations on those benefits than are placed on medical and surgical benefits under that plan.) Additionally, HHS must establish a consumer parity unit: (1) to facilitate the collection of, monitoring of, and response to consumer complaints; and (2) to provide consumers information about the disclosure requirements and enforcement of the mental health parity laws.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
