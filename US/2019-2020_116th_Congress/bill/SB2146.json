Specifically, a court may reduce the prison term for a defendant if (1) the imposed prison term was more than 10 years; (2) the defendant has served at least 10 years in custody; and (3) the court finds that the defendant is not a danger to public safety, is ready for reentry, and the interests of justice warrant a sentence modification. The bill outlines the factors a court may consider in reducing a prison term. Further, the bill creates a rebuttable presumption of release for a defendant who is 50 years of age or older on the date of the petition.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-17","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3795","sast_bill_id":1271615}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047422,"date":"2019-07-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2146\/id\/2047422","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2146\/BILLS-116s2146is.pdf","text_size":383043,"text_hash":"e7dbe980a1bbf6c3f60cdfdfc97db597"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
