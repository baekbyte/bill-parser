First, the bill requires individuals with net assets of more than $1 billion on December 31, 2020, to pay a tax of 60% on the amount equal to the lesser of (1) the increase in value of their net assets during the period beginning on March 18, 2020, through such date, or (2) the value of their net assets that is greater than $1 billion. The Department of the Treasury must establish rules for the application of this tax to married individuals and this tax is not deductible for the purpose of federal income tax. Further, the bill covers the costs for services provided through public or private health insurance and to uninsured individuals, including prescription drugs and care related to COVID-19, for a period of one year beginning on the date of enactment of this bill. Health insurance plans are prohibited from increasing the cost-sharing requirements of plans while this program is in effect and HHS must report to Congress on the program on a weekly basis.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6906","sast_bill_id":1366104},{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB8020","sast_bill_id":1376035},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3790","sast_bill_id":1366653}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":81071,"subject_name":"Debt collection"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":27753,"subject_name":"Property tax"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207295,"date":"2020-09-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4490\/id\/2207295","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4490\/BILLS-116s4490is.pdf","text_size":324061,"text_hash":"448ee2b98248fc937a533c1dfe526da5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
