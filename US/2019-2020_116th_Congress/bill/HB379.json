A remote seller is a seller with no physical presence in the state in which the purchaser is located at the time of the purchase. A state may not impose the requirements for collecting taxes or fees and related information on a remote seller unless the purchase occurs after this bill takes effect and the tax or fee is imposed under a statute in effect in the state where the purchaser is located at the time of the purchase. A subdivision of a state may not impose the requirements on a remote seller. The tax or fee must apply to purchases throughout the state of the good or service. The rate must be uniform and may not exceed the combined rate of the state and local taxes and fees payable by purchasers in the state of the good or service from sellers physically present in the state. The state statute may not require the seller to (1) remit the taxes or fees to more than one location, or (2) provide information about the purchaser other than the zip code of the purchase and the aggregate amount of fees or taxes collected in a particular zip code.","pending_committee_id":4044,"committee":{"committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-09","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11053,"person_hash":"6o3k1bdd","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bob Gibbs","first_name":"Bob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gibbs","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-7","ftm_eid":3104545,"votesmart_id":45466,"opensecrets_id":"N00031128","knowwho_pid":212534,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Gibbs","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19403,"person_hash":"dr9bgbef","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Greg Gianforte","first_name":"Greg","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Gianforte","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MT","ftm_eid":7734214,"votesmart_id":168594,"opensecrets_id":"N00040733","knowwho_pid":574195,"ballotpedia":"Greg_Gianforte","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13523,"subject_name":"Retail and wholesale trades"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1871885,"date":"2019-01-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB379\/id\/1871885","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr379\/BILLS-116hr379ih.pdf","text_size":126897,"text_hash":"86a9189bf9af1c855d8b1a1ee9f96298"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
