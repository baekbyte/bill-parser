If the VA updates the questionnaire form, previous versions of the form filed by claimants must be accepted for up to one year after the form was updated. The VA may waive interagency approval processes required to approve a modification to a form if such requirement applies by reason of the form being made public on the website as required by the bill. The Inspector General of the VA must, through 2026, annually report on the use of such forms.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-27","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2020-09-16","committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs"},{"date":"2020-09-23","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-22","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-22","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
