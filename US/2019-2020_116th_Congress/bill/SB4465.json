Specifically, the Department of Education must award grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) and, through them, emergency financial-aid grants to students. An IHE must, among other things, ensure that an emergency for which a student is eligible to receive a grant includes financial challenges that impact the student's ability to continue their course of study (e.g., loss of employment). Further, the bill prohibits an emergency financial-aid grant from being (1) treated as other financial assistance for the purposes of calculating a student's amount of need, or (2) considered in determining the amount of financial aid or eligibility for other public benefits for succeeding academic years.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9408,"person_hash":"r7nps3ip","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Amy Klobuchar","first_name":"Amy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klobuchar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":17659011,"votesmart_id":65092,"opensecrets_id":"N00027500","knowwho_pid":248506,"ballotpedia":"Amy_Klobuchar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206664,"date":"2020-08-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4465\/id\/2206664","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4465\/BILLS-116s4465is.pdf","text_size":317115,"text_hash":"0743d3f3b649b0a6eb55b3111c53c5e6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
