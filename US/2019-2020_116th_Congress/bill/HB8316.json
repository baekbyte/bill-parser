Specifically, ED must discharge the federal student loan debt of a borrower (1) who is covered by ED findings against an institution of higher education (IHE) for job placement rate misrepresentation; (2) for whom a state attorney general has asserted a right to borrower defense discharge; or (3) who was subject to a misrepresentation made by the IHE related to guaranteed employment or transferability of credits, and who has asserted such misrepresentation in a borrower defense application. ED must reimburse a borrower for amounts paid toward the federal student loan. The bill also requires ED to (1) notify borrowers of loan relief and eligibility for financial aid, and (2) report loan discharge to consumer reporting agencies. Finally, ED must initiate a proceeding to require the IHE whose act or omission resulted in loan discharge to repay ED for such amounts.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-18","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15239,"person_hash":"2abxxyrw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Takano","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Takano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-41","ftm_eid":17657771,"votesmart_id":22337,"opensecrets_id":"N00006701","knowwho_pid":378804,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Takano","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3745","sast_bill_id":1365969}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2211322,"date":"2020-10-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8316\/id\/2211322","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8316\/BILLS-116hr8316ih.pdf","text_size":301241,"text_hash":"e7500e6a3db58c9ca6ff6baff50b18e7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
