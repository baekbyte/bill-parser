Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must establish certain quality measures for PDP sponsors to use when determining incentive payments and adjustments (e.g., performance payments) to pharmacies.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-04","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Read
