Specifically, HHS shall not impose specified conditions on faith-based organizations regarding the receipt of HHS funds or the participation in HHS programs, such as requirements to disclose religious affiliation, if those conditions are not imposed on organizations that are not faith-based. In addition, HHS shall not require any organization to refer a beneficiary who objects to the religious character of that organization to an alternative provider. States and local governments that administer HHS funds must adhere to these requirements, as well. Under current law, these restrictions apply to HHS financial assistance and programs through an executive order concerning the administration of federal grants and programs related to faith-based organizations.","pending_committee_id":4148,"committee":{"committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-05","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2020-03-17","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-03","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
