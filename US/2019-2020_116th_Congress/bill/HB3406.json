Currently, all Medicare SNFs are included in the program, and their quality of care is determined based on a hospital readmissions measure. The bill excludes from the program SNFs for which there is not a minimum number of applicable cases or measures, as set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), for the performance period. Additionally, the bill allows the CMS to apply up to 10 additional quality measures, including measures relating to patient safety and care coordination.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-21","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-06-24","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9307,"person_hash":"4cughglp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Richard Neal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Neal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-1","ftm_eid":17441075,"votesmart_id":26895,"opensecrets_id":"N00000153","knowwho_pid":158876,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Neal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9173,"person_hash":"wb8x9wzo","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kevin Brady","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brady","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-8","ftm_eid":11362722,"votesmart_id":361,"opensecrets_id":"N00005883","knowwho_pid":159078,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Brady_(Texas)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HB3417","sast_bill_id":1269876}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2043782,"date":"2019-06-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3406\/id\/2043782","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3406\/BILLS-116hr3406ih.pdf","text_size":248141,"text_hash":"686001dad6d7b42dcc782a45e7b5efde"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
