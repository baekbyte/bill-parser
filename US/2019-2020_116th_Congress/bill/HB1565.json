The Center must use the system to calculate student education, debt-related, and earning metrics (e.g., student graduation rates, transfer rates, rates of continuation to subsequent levels of education, dropout rates, loan debt amounts, loan repayment rates, and debt-to-earnings ratios) for each institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs. The metrics must be disaggregated and separately provided on the basis of specified categories. The system must meet requirements for minimizing privacy and security risks. The bill provides for the transition from the existing Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to the new higher education data system. The Department of Education (ED) must publish the metrics and post the metrics on its website. Within five years, an IHE that participates in federal student aid programs must display links on its website to ED's website that provides metrics data.","pending_committee_id":2598,"committee":{"committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-06","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},{"date":"2019-03-07","committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"},{"date":"2019-03-29","committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Armed Services, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Armed Services, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Armed Services, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-06","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Armed Services, Veterans' Affairs, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9228,"person_hash":"ytoqefw4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Duncan Hunter","first_name":"Duncan","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Hunter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-50","ftm_eid":17658760,"votesmart_id":104308,"opensecrets_id":"N00029258","knowwho_pid":272496,"ballotpedia":"Duncan_Hunter","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15235,"person_hash":"mdfdtnth","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Peters","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-52","ftm_eid":14148706,"votesmart_id":70351,"opensecrets_id":"N00033591","knowwho_pid":378729,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Peters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9177,"person_hash":"tryqw5x1","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Conaway","first_name":"K.
