A highly automated vehicle is a motor vehicle, other than a commercial motor vehicle, that is equipped with an automated driving system capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis. The bill preempts states from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of highly automated vehicles or automated driving systems unless such laws enact standards identical to federal standards. The Department of Transportation (DOT) must require safety assessment certifications for the development of a highly automated vehicle or an automated driving system. Manufacturers of highly automated vehicles must develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The bill applies certain safety exemptions and testing standards to highly automated vehicles. DOT must (1) inform prospective buyers of highly automated vehicles of the capabilities and limitations of such vehicles; (2) establish the Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council to, among other things, develop guidance regarding mobility access for the disabled, elderly, and underserved populations; (3) require all new passenger motor vehicles less than 10,000 pounds to be equipped with a rear seat occupant alert system; and (4) research updated safety standards for motor vehicle headlamps.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-23","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2020-09-24","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9216,"person_hash":"lkizgzxc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Latta","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Latta","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-5","ftm_eid":3428798,"votesmart_id":9926,"opensecrets_id":"N00012233","knowwho_pid":209172,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Latta","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":654}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13128,"subject_name":"Aging"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13185,"subject_name":"Federal preemption"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13519,"subject_name":"Hybrid, electric, and advanced technology vehicles"},{"subject_id":321502,"subject_name":"Lighting, heating, cooling"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13891,"subject_name":"Technology assessment"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2211917,"date":"2020-10-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8350\/id\/2211917","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8350\/BILLS-116hr8350ih.pdf","text_size":350213,"text_hash":"537178191beaadd2fb973ae57dc55b43"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
