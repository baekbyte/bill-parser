Specifically, the Department of Energy (DOE) must establish the Home Energy Savings Retrofit Rebate Program. Under the program, DOE must provide rebates to reward homeowners for achieving home energy savings. Rebates may not exceed $10,000 per individual, or 50% of the qualified home energy efficiency expenditures paid or incurred by the homeowner. DOE must develop a network of rebate aggregators or a national rebate aggregator that can facilitate the delivery of rebates to reimburse participating homeowners or contractors. In addition, DOE must develop guidelines for allowing utilities participating as rebate aggregators to count the energy savings from their participation toward state and local level energy saving targets. provides for the tax treatment of rebates, including an exclusion of such rebates from the taxable income of the homeowner. DOE must also make grants to states, Native American tribes, and Alaska Natives for carrying the programs established by this bill, including the development of quality assurance programs to oversee the delivery of home efficiency retrofit programs. Finally, DOE must establish a Residential Energy Efficiency Pay for Performance pilot program to encourage the use of measured energy savings, and financial payments for those energy savings, in the operation of residential energy efficiency programs.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-03","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-04-04","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11063,"person_hash":"zxbr0ie0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David McKinley","first_name":"David","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"McKinley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WV-1","ftm_eid":7565199,"votesmart_id":117396,"opensecrets_id":"N00031681","knowwho_pid":284510,"ballotpedia":"David_McKinley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2741","sast_bill_id":1261634}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13594,"subject_name":"Contracts and agency"},{"subject_id":13155,"subject_name":"Department of Energy"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13528,"subject_name":"Environmental technology"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":321502,"subject_name":"Lighting, heating, cooling"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13703,"subject_name":"Women in business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1994718,"date":"2019-04-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2043\/id\/1994718","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2043\/BILLS-116hr2043ih.pdf","text_size":223952,"text_hash":"9b39af441dbf7ffd7d60f9588f8063e3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
