The bill increases from $100,000 to $400,000 the annual limit on the aggregate amount of distributions for charitable purposes that may be excluded from the gross income of a taxpayer. The bill permits tax-free distributions from IRAs to a split-interest entity for four years after the enactment of this bill. A split-interest entity is exclusively funded by charitable distributions and includes: a charitable remainder annuity trust, a charitable remainder unitrust, or a charitable gift annuity. A charitable gift annuity must commence fixed payments of at least 5% no later than one year from the date of funding. A distribution to a split-interest entity may only be treated as a qualified charitable distribution if: (1) no person holds an income interest in the entity other than the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained, the spouse of such individual, or both; and (2) the income interest in the entity is nonassignable.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-18","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16488,"person_hash":"g9uiscjq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Beyer","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Beyer","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-8","ftm_eid":1579842,"votesmart_id":1707,"opensecrets_id":"N00036018","knowwho_pid":487540,"ballotpedia":"Don_Beyer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11137,"person_hash":"3ixm419p","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Kelly","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-3","ftm_eid":5007914,"votesmart_id":119463,"opensecrets_id":"N00031647","knowwho_pid":286955,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Kelly_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11201,"person_hash":"wknbt2m7","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Terri Sewell","first_name":"Terri","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Sewell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AL-7","ftm_eid":17657351,"votesmart_id":121621,"opensecrets_id":"N00030622","knowwho_pid":283908,"ballotpedia":"Terri_Sewell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11606,"person_hash":"xk5qn52a","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Schweikert","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schweikert","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-6","ftm_eid":8573431,"votesmart_id":106387,"opensecrets_id":"N00006460","knowwho_pid":267202,"ballotpedia":"David_Schweikert","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15213,"person_hash":"01n0nehx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Susan Brooks","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brooks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-5","ftm_eid":17657978,"votesmart_id":135988,"opensecrets_id":"N00033495","knowwho_pid":378487,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Brooks","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9010,"person_hash":"wwcneni0","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Blumenauer","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-3","ftm_eid":4977792,"votesmart_id":367,"opensecrets_id":"N00007727","knowwho_pid":159028,"ballotpedia":"Earl_Blumenauer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1257","sast_bill_id":1255660}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":81061,"subject_name":"Charitable contributions"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13226,"subject_name":"Income tax exclusion"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047548,"date":"2019-07-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3832\/id\/2047548","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3832\/BILLS-116hr3832ih.pdf","text_size":367963,"text_hash":"c0ce118675aa5fb90ab8a9b764764c4b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
