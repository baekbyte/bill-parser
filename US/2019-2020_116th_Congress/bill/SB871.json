The bill abolishes the White Sands National Monument and incorporates the lands and interests that comprise the monument in and as a part of the park. The Department of the Interior shall not nominate the park for inclusion on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) unless each county in which the park is located concurs in the nomination. Before submitting such a nomination, Interior must notify the Department of the Army of its intention to nominate the park for inclusion on the list. Interior must complete an official boundary survey of the park. The bill modifies the boundaries of the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and the Public Land Order 833 (relating to the withdrawal of certain public lands in New Mexico for use by the Army for military purposes and the revoking of certain executive orders and public land orders) to exclude the land transferred to Interior and to include the land transferred to the Army. The Army shall administer the land transferred to it as a part of the missile range.","pending_committee_id":2320,"committee":{"committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-26","committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-26","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9472,"person_hash":"4c2m8lz3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Udall","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Udall","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NM","ftm_eid":1864753,"votesmart_id":22658,"opensecrets_id":"N00006561","knowwho_pid":158967,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Udall","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1790","sast_bill_id":1267965},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2500","sast_bill_id":1256454},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR476","sast_bill_id":1271185},{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1891","sast_bill_id":1245139},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR758","sast_bill_id":1288053},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1582","sast_bill_id":1263664}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13485,"subject_name":"Military procurement, research, weapons development"},{"subject_id":13410,"subject_name":"Monuments and memorials"},{"subject_id":13563,"subject_name":"New Mexico"},{"subject_id":13257,"subject_name":"Parks, recreation areas, trails"},{"subject_id":13244,"subject_name":"Military facilities and property"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1984821,"date":"2019-04-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB871\/id\/1984821","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s871\/BILLS-116s871is.pdf","text_size":293074,"text_hash":"9b27a328c4d00c03a662da6697df5897"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
