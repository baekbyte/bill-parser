(A micro-grid system means a stand-alone electrical system that uses grid-scale energy storage.) DOE must also establish a grant program to carry out projects related to the modernization of the electric grid, including the application of technologies to improve observability, advanced controls, and prediction of system performance on the distribution system.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-30","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
