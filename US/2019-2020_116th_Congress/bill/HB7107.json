The PLUM Book contains personnel information for federal civil service leadership and support positions in the legislative and executive branches that may be subject to noncompetitive appointment, including heads of agencies and policy executives. The book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions and is published every four years (after each presidential election) by certain congressional committees. The bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to publish the information contained in the PLUM Book on a public website in a format that is easily searchable and that otherwise meets certain data standards. Agencies must upload updated information to the website on a monthly basis; OPM must verify the accuracy of the information twice a year in coordination with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. The bill terminates publication of the PLUM Book in its current form on January 1, 2024.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-04","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and in addition to the Committee on House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9086,"person_hash":"1ztgbts1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Carolyn Maloney","first_name":"Carolyn","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-12","ftm_eid":17658243,"votesmart_id":26978,"opensecrets_id":"N00000078","knowwho_pid":158983,"ballotpedia":"Carolyn_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8964,"person_hash":"2drw2yg6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gerald Connolly","first_name":"Gerald","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Connolly","suffix":"","nickname":"Gerry","district":"HD-VA-11","ftm_eid":16577898,"votesmart_id":95078,"opensecrets_id":"N00029891","knowwho_pid":267105,"ballotpedia":"Gerald_Connolly","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9123,"person_hash":"rsmtoq6c","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Sarbanes","first_name":"John","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Sarbanes","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-3","ftm_eid":17658676,"votesmart_id":66575,"opensecrets_id":"N00027751","knowwho_pid":248303,"ballotpedia":"John_Sarbanes","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3896","sast_bill_id":1368541}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13894,"subject_name":"Books and print media"},{"subject_id":13145,"subject_name":"Congressional agencies"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13887,"subject_name":"Digital media"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13199,"subject_name":"Government ethics and transparency, public corruption"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13770,"subject_name":"Office of Personnel Management (OPM)"},{"subject_id":13888,"subject_name":"Personnel records"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2198232,"date":"2020-06-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7107\/id\/2198232","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7107\/BILLS-116hr7107ih.pdf","text_size":322122,"text_hash":"bb307dafa864dbc63125679027c2b715"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2020-09-16","time":"10:00","location":"2154 RHOB","description":"House Committee on Oversight and Reform Hearing"}]}}
