Under the program, Native American tribes or organizations may receive grants to plan for participation in self-governance and to negotiate the terms of participation. In addition, the bill revises the Department of the Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with tribes. Interior must negotiate contracts and funding agreements to maximize implementation of the self-governance policy. The bill sets forth requirements for tribes participating in self-governance with respect to conflicts of interest, audits, redesign and consolidation of programs, retrocession of programs, non-duplication of funding, and records. Funding agreements must include provisions for Interior to monitor the performance of trust functions by the tribe and to reassume a program and funding under specified circumstances. Tribes participating in self-governance may elect to assume some federal responsibilities with respect to certain construction projects. The bill prohibits obligating a tribe to continue performance of a compact or funding agreement that provides insufficient funding.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-24","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"},{"date":"2019-06-28","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-07-03","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Committee on Indian Affairs.
