Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a streamlined process whereby a private entity may voluntarily share information about unlawful robocalls or text messages and unlawful caller identification spoofing. In addition, the bill authorizes a telecommunications company to provide a free, opt-in robocall blocking service to its customers. The FCC must also study and report on whether a Voice Over Internet Protocol service should be required to provide the FCC with its contact information and retain records of all calls transmitted over the service.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-29","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
