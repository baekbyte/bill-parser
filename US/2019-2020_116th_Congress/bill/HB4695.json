Such foreign persons shall also be subject to visa- and asset-blocking sanctions. The President shall impose financial sanctions on the large Turkish state-owned bank known as Halkbank and on any foreign financial institutions that the State Department determines to have knowingly facilitated significant transactions for the Turkish Armed Forces or Turkey's defense industry related to the invasion. The President shall impose sanctions on Turkey's government pursuant to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. A U.S. defense article, service, or technology may not be transferred to Turkey's government if it (1) is covered under the Arms Export Control Act, and (2) may be used by Turkey in military operations in northern Syria. The President may not exercise certain emergency waiver authority in relation to this prohibition.
