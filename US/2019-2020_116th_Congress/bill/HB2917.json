Specifically, the bill prohibits (1) knowingly making false advertising or marketing claims regarding the addictive nature of opioids; (2) knowingly supplying communities with quantities of opioids that are not medically reasonable; or (3) failing to report distribution orders, or patterns of orders, while knowing that the orders are not being dispensed in a medically reasonable manner. Employees of opioid manufacturers and distributors are subject to civil penalties and imprisonment for violations; corporations and executives are subject to civil penalties. Manufacturers shall also lose their period of market exclusivity. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must assess a fee against each corporation that, between January 1, 1993, and the date of enactment of this bill, manufactured or distributed opioids, if such opioids were covered under a federal health program at least once during this period. Manufacturers that fail to pay the fee shall lose associated drug approval until the fee is paid in full. The bill authorizes collected civil penalties and fees to be used for activities that address opioid misuse and abuse, including family and educational programs.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15054,"person_hash":"g7jsudzc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tulsi Gabbard","first_name":"Tulsi","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gabbard","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-2","ftm_eid":6401344,"votesmart_id":129306,"opensecrets_id":"N00033281","knowwho_pid":378573,"ballotpedia":"Tulsi_Gabbard","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18314,"person_hash":"mapln5bo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ro Khanna","first_name":"Ro","middle_name":"","last_name":"Khanna","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-17","ftm_eid":373494,"votesmart_id":29473,"opensecrets_id":"N00026427","knowwho_pid":281537,"ballotpedia":"Ro_Khanna","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1584","sast_bill_id":1263667}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13345,"subject_name":"Drug trafficking and controlled substances"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2034627,"date":"2019-06-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2917\/id\/2034627","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2917\/BILLS-116hr2917ih.pdf","text_size":383626,"text_hash":"98aa190bba68bad8d22a008696092de6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
