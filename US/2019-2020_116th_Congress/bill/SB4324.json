Among other things, the bill (1) prohibits the use of federal funds for procurement of PPE items not produced in the United States, and (2) establishes a $7.5 billion tax credit for investment in certain medical PPE manufacturing projects. The bill also addresses the security of federally funded research and development grants and export-controlled goods, technologies, or sensitive information, including by establishing a Federal Research Security Council to develop research and development grant making policy and management guidance to protect the national and economic security interests of the United States. Further, it prohibits any federal grant application that fails to disclose the receipt of any outside compensation, including foreign compensation. The bill establishes investments and incentives to support U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and supply chain security, such as requiring the National Institute of Standards and Technology to carry out a semiconductor manufacturing program to accelerate research and development for next generation semiconductors. Lastly, the bill addresses availability, development, and production of domestic critical minerals by (1) requiring the President to coordinate agencies to implement U.S. policy regarding critical minerals, including by establishing a capability for identifying critical mineral demand and supply; (2) establishing a grant program for critical mineral education, training, and workforce development programs at institutions of higher education; and (3) reauthorizing through FY2030 the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-27","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Read
