The changes to the budget process include converting the existing annual budget and appropriations process to a biennial process; changing the calendar period for the federal fiscal year (currently October 1 through September 30) to January 1 through December 31; requiring mandatory spending programs to be subject to the appropriations process with exceptions for Social Security, Medicare, programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and TRICARE; requiring the baseline budget of each department or agency to be assumed to be zero and each proposed expenditure to be justified as if it were a new expenditure; requiring Congress to consider appropriations bills using procedures similar to the existing budget reconciliation process, which includes expedited procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate; and withholding pay for Members of Congress if the House and Senate have not jointly agreed to a congressional budget resolution by June 30 of the first year of a Congress.","pending_committee_id":2300,"committee":{"committee_id":2300,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Budget"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2300,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Budget"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, Oversight and Reform, and House Administration, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18323,"person_hash":"rzodhwub","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Mitchell","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitchell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-10","ftm_eid":79401,"votesmart_id":152464,"opensecrets_id":"N00036274","knowwho_pid":495790,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Mitchell","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16101,"person_hash":"a588ol2u","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bradley Byrne","first_name":"Bradley","middle_name":"","last_name":"Byrne","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AL-1","ftm_eid":6583839,"votesmart_id":27584,"opensecrets_id":"N00035380","knowwho_pid":212089,"ballotpedia":"Bradley_Byrne","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9213,"person_hash":"86i58pyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Cole","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cole","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-4","ftm_eid":14964187,"votesmart_id":46034,"opensecrets_id":"N00025726","knowwho_pid":211693,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cole_(Oklahoma)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB236","sast_bill_id":1137561},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5538","sast_bill_id":1294855}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13588,"subject_name":"Members of Congress"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1969899,"date":"2019-03-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1536\/id\/1969899","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1536\/BILLS-116hr1536ih.pdf","text_size":336653,"text_hash":"079383f997977088ec261188dc946e63"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
