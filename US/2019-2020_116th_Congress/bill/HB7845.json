Eligible remote recreational businesses must (1) have experienced a loss in revenue that is greater than 50% between March 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020, as compared with the same period in the previous year; and (2) show that the closure of the U.S.-Canada border restricted the ability of American customers to access the location of such business. The maximum loan amount shall be equal to 75% of the business's FY2019 revenue, and the SBA shall forgive 100% of the value of such loan, less the amount the borrower received from (1) any other loan forgiveness program, and (2) any emergency advance under the economic impact disaster loan program.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-29","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9154,"person_hash":"0gala4ad","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Collin Peterson","first_name":"Collin","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peterson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-7","ftm_eid":16588347,"votesmart_id":26926,"opensecrets_id":"N00004558","knowwho_pid":158917,"ballotpedia":"Collin_Peterson","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4560","sast_bill_id":1377682}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13742,"subject_name":"Canada"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13569,"subject_name":"Outdoor recreation"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205717,"date":"2020-08-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7845\/id\/2205717","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7845\/BILLS-116hr7845ih.pdf","text_size":302530,"text_hash":"ee876bc15cf582035808000cd80c33f9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
