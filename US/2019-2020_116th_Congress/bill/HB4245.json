Specifically, the Department of Education (ED) shall not require an applicant to provide income or asset information if the applicant indicates they received a federal benefit (e.g., supplemental nutrition assistance or Social Security disability) at some time during the previous 24 months. ED shall use a data retrieval tool to obtain such information for any other applicant. The bill raises to $34,000 the amount of household income below which a student shall be considered to have an expected family contribution (EFC) equal to zero. EFC is used to calculate individual financial aid awards, and an EFC of zero means that a student's family is deemed unable to contribute to educational expenses.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-09","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20086,"person_hash":"mx4wqyxe","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lucy McBath","first_name":"Lucy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McBath","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-6","ftm_eid":44893293,"votesmart_id":178538,"opensecrets_id":"N00042813","knowwho_pid":658185,"ballotpedia":"Lucy_McBath","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20061,"person_hash":"hgpd80bs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jesus Garcia","first_name":"Jesus","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garcia","suffix":"","nickname":"Chuy","district":"HD-IL-4","ftm_eid":28299070,"votesmart_id":6261,"opensecrets_id":"N00042114","knowwho_pid":645347,"ballotpedia":"Jesus_Garcia","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4674","sast_bill_id":1276853}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2052413,"date":"2019-09-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4245\/id\/2052413","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4245\/BILLS-116hr4245ih.pdf","text_size":363388,"text_hash":"13347795f01e46e6c7bdc40f8467d624"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
