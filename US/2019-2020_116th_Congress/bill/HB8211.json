Specifically, the bill adds policy goals, at least one of which a CDC must demonstrate to be eligible for assistance. These include (1) enhancing the ability of a small business to reduce costs by using energy efficient products and generating renewable energy, and (2) aiding the revitalization of any area for which a disaster has been declared or determined. The bill also authorizes a CDC to take specified actions to facilitate the closing of a 504 loan, such as correcting borrower or lender information on loan documents or reallocating up to 10% of the cost of a project, and it establishes an express loan closing program for a 504 loan that is less than $500,000. Further, the bill authorizes a CDC to refinance up to 100% of costs for expansion projects, and it establishes specified requirements for refinancing projects that do not involve expansion. The bill also modifies the requirements for projects to construct a new facility or to acquire, renoavate, or reconstruct an existing building. For small manufacturers, the bill (1) increases the maximum loan amount from $5.5 million to $6.5 million, (2) reduces the amount that they must contribute to project costs, (3) increases job retention requirements, and (4) revises collateral requirements. Further, each SBA district office must partner with a resource partner to provide certain training for small manufacturers.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-11","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},{"date":"2020-12-07","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Ms. Velazquez moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
