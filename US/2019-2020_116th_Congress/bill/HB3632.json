The bill modifies policy considerations relating to air carrier certificates to require DOT to consider preventing entry into U.S. markets by flag of convenience carriers (i.e., foreign air carriers established in a country other the home country of their majority owner in order to avoid regulations of the home country) and preventing the undermining of labor standards. In carrying out such air carrier certificate requirements, DOT must consider preventing entry of flag of convenience carriers into U.S. markets as being in the public interest and consistent with public convenience and necessity for safety in air transportation and air commerce. In formulating U.S. international air transportation policy relating to the elimination of discrimination and unfair competition, the Department of State and DOT must include in their considerations the undermining of labor standards.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-09","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-07-10","committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Aviation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Subcommittee on Aviation Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-09","action":"Reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
