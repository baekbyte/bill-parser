The tax is equal to $40 per ton of carbon contained in fuel (1) produced at a coal mine or an oil or gas well located in the United States; or (2) entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. The bill requires the tax rate to be adjusted for inflation. The bill also allows a refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for each individual taxpayer and each dependent of the taxpayer. The credit must be reduced by a specified amount if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $314,000 ($157,000 in the case of a return other than a joint return). The bill requires that the dollar amounts of the credit be adjusted for inflation and specifies that nonresident aliens are ineligible for the credit.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-17","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-17","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14138,"person_hash":"oq69ym4f","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sean Maloney","first_name":"Sean","middle_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-18","ftm_eid":4512254,"votesmart_id":139760,"opensecrets_id":"N00034277","knowwho_pid":413491,"ballotpedia":"Sean_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2081805,"date":"2019-12-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5457\/id\/2081805","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5457\/BILLS-116hr5457ih.pdf","text_size":326644,"text_hash":"ddea3939f7c5d226e07e5a62b95aa3b9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
