Grants must be used for (1) replacement of cast and wrought iron and bare steel pipes and other leak-prone components of the natural gas distribution system, or (2) inspection and maintenance programs for such system. In awarding grants under the program, DOE must prioritize applications based on the expected results of a project with respect to (1) quantifiable benefits for public safety, (2) the magnitude of methane emissions reductions, (3) innovation in technical or policy approaches, (4) the number of low-income households anticipated to benefit from the assistance, and (5) overall cost-effectiveness of the project.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-07","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2020-01-08","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-09","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-09","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20103,"person_hash":"clc8hanm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rebecca Sherrill","first_name":"Rebecca","middle_name":"Michelle","last_name":"Sherrill","suffix":"","nickname":"Mikie","district":"HD-NJ-11","ftm_eid":43965079,"votesmart_id":179651,"opensecrets_id":"N00041154","knowwho_pid":625260,"ballotpedia":"Mikie_Sherrill","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18292,"person_hash":"c8kj8aoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lisa Rochester","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"Blunt","last_name":"Rochester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DE","ftm_eid":38420440,"votesmart_id":173249,"opensecrets_id":"N00038414","knowwho_pid":558891,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Blunt_Rochester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2741","sast_bill_id":1261634}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13179,"subject_name":"Energy assistance for the poor and aged"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13795,"subject_name":"Energy prices"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13234,"subject_name":"Labor standards"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13392,"subject_name":"Pipelines"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2088294,"date":"2020-01-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5542\/id\/2088294","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5542\/BILLS-116hr5542ih.pdf","text_size":325643,"text_hash":"b49a5169341a4a876ea5f96a20175023"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
