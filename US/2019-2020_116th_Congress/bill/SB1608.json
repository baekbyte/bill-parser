HHS must publish updated reports that detail evidence-based practices and highlight continuing physical-activity issues between the publications of full reports. Updated reports may focus on particular population subgroups or issues relating to physical activity. A federal agency that proposes to issue physical-activity recommendations that differ from the recommendations in the most recent full report must consider the recommendations in reports issued under this bill.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},{"date":"2019-12-23","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-12-24","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-31","action":"Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
