(A community solar facility is a solar photovoltaic system that allocates electricity to multiple individual electric consumers of an electric utility and has a nameplate rating of 2 megawatts or less.) Specifically, the bill requires each state regulatory authority and nonregulated electric utility to commence consideration of and determine ratemaking standards that allow community solar facilities to be connected to the power distribution system. The bill does not apply in the case of any electric utility in a state if (1) the state has implemented the standard in accordance with the bill (or a comparable one) for the electric utility, (2) the state regulatory authority or the relevant nonregulated electric utility has conducted a proceeding to consider implementation of the standard (or a comparable one) for the electric utility, or (3) the state legislature has voted on the implementation of the standard (or a comparable one) for the electric utility.","pending_committee_id":2933,"committee":{"committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-06","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-08-07","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20120,"person_hash":"nuddykio","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Van Drew","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Drew","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-2","ftm_eid":6389812,"votesmart_id":24685,"opensecrets_id":"N00042164","knowwho_pid":209970,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Van_Drew","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18327,"person_hash":"ne1btca3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jamie Raskin","first_name":"Jamie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Raskin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-8","ftm_eid":1066956,"votesmart_id":65904,"opensecrets_id":"N00037036","knowwho_pid":248823,"ballotpedia":"Jamie_Raskin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20068,"person_hash":"e1243zkk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debra Haaland","first_name":"Debra","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haaland","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8997515,"votesmart_id":149368,"opensecrets_id":"N00040933","knowwho_pid":491018,"ballotpedia":"Debra_Haaland","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18298,"person_hash":"reoz38xt","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Charlie Crist","first_name":"Charlie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crist","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-13","ftm_eid":1736080,"votesmart_id":24311,"opensecrets_id":"N00002942","knowwho_pid":218595,"ballotpedia":"Charlie_Crist","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049384,"date":"2019-08-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4175\/id\/2049384","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4175\/BILLS-116hr4175ih.pdf","text_size":363825,"text_hash":"2045a9cf4d518324dcb7e421b20a9de3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
