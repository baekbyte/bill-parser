It also provides for advance payments of credit amounts to taxpayers on a monthly basis and allows a disregard of credit amounts for purposes of determining eligibility for federal or state assistance programs. The bill directs the Internal Revenue Service to establish a Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program to provide tax return preparation assistance to low-income taxpayers. The bill expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the cost of this bill should be fully offset by (1) the repeal of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (except for provisions of that Act that provide relief to taxpayers with annual incomes of less than $100,000), and (2) a fee on financial institutions with consolidated assets of more than $50 billion.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
