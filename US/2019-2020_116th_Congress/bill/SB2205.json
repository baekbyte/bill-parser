Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Labor to pay the attorneys' fees of prevailing parties on a qualifying benefit claim; give a claimant the opportunity to substantiate a claim for benefits through a pulmonary evaluation; authorize a CT (computerized tomography) scan in diagnosing complicated pneumoconiosis; educate certain individuals who work on black lung benefits about medical evidence relevant to claims; use data from continuous personal dust monitors to determine whether to make changes to respirable dust concentration standards, controls, and measurements; and develop a strategy to reduce delays in adjudication of black lung benefits claims. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report on barriers to health care faced by coal miners with black lung. The bill authorizes (1) black lung clinics to use federal funds to help individuals file claims, and (2) previously denied claimants to file a new claim for black lung benefits within one year. The bill prohibits a person from (1) knowingly and willfully making a false statement or misrepresentation in increasing or reducing black lung benefits, or (2) threatening or misleading a participant in a proceeding regarding black lung benefits. Further, the bill revises (1) the standards of medical evidence that establish a presumption that a miner is totally disabled by black lung, and (2) payments to such miners. Lastly, the bill provides statutory authority for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-23","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15418,"person_hash":"0wvwru9t","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Kaine","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kaine","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":5743146,"votesmart_id":50772,"opensecrets_id":"N00033177","knowwho_pid":140385,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Kaine","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9625,"person_hash":"7pac6cxl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joe Manchin","first_name":"Joe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Manchin","suffix":"III","nickname":"","district":"SD-WV","ftm_eid":7573477,"votesmart_id":7547,"opensecrets_id":"N00032838","knowwho_pid":219013,"ballotpedia":"Joe_Manchin_III","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13328,"subject_name":"Labor and employment"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13141,"subject_name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13864,"subject_name":"Legal fees and court costs"},{"subject_id":13507,"subject_name":"Medical ethics"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047843,"date":"2019-08-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2205\/id\/2047843","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2205\/BILLS-116s2205is.pdf","text_size":439440,"text_hash":"ac12783a0e90a6565c2d7a1ba7c4bfb4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
