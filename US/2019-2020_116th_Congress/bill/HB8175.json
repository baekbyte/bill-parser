After 2021, the tax increases by $10 each year and does not apply if specified emissions reduction benchmarks have been attained.

The funds must be used, as provided by appropriations Acts, to offset reductions in individual income tax rates, pay quarterly dividends to certain individuals with valid Social Security numbers; and for specified worker transition assistance, energy, research, and infrastructure priorities.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-04","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2020-09-08","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space, and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space, and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space, and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space, and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, Science, Space, and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8985,"person_hash":"efkdmpyu","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jerry McNerney","first_name":"Jerry","middle_name":"","last_name":"McNerney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-9","ftm_eid":6643414,"votesmart_id":29474,"opensecrets_id":"N00026926","knowwho_pid":248236,"ballotpedia":"Jerry_McNerney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207658,"date":"2020-09-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8175\/id\/2207658","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8175\/BILLS-116hr8175ih.pdf","text_size":320321,"text_hash":"85ac3f2781a76124f92d80710f276c91"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
