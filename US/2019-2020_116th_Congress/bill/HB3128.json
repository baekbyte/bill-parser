Specifically, this bill gives students (or groups of students) enrolled at institutions of higher education (IHEs) the right to form or join social organizations, including single-sex social organizations. In addition, the bill prohibits IHEs that participate in federal student aid programs from taking actions that require or coerce students or social organizations to waive their rights; taking adverse actions against students who are members of single-sex social organizations, or against single-sex social organizations, based solely on the membership practice of limiting membership to only individuals of one sex; or placing recruitment restrictions on single-sex social organizations, which are not imposed upon other student organizations, without the written agreement of the organizations.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
