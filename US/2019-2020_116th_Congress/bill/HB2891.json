HHS must publish updated reports that detail evidence-based practices and highlight continuing physical activity issues between the publications of full reports. Updated reports may focus on particular population subgroups or issues relating to physical activity. A federal agency that proposes to issue physical activity recommendations that differ from the recommendations in the most recent full report must submit the proposed recommendations to HHS for review.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
