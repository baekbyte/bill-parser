Covered service providers must provide opt-in approval through express user consent to use sensitive information such as financial data, health information, browsing history, or other specified personally identifiable information. Such service providers must obtain opt-out approval for the use of non-sensitive user information by a user failing to object to such use after being provided notice of the provider's privacy policies. Service providers also must allow users to opt-in or opt-out of such approval at any time. The bill permits service providers to use and disclose user information without approval for specified purposes, including for services necessary for provision of the service and to initiate, render, bill, and collect for the service. The bill further prohibits providers from conditioning access to service on users' agreeing to waive their privacy rights.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-10","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1998087,"date":"2019-04-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1116\/id\/1998087","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1116\/BILLS-116s1116is.pdf","text_size":333405,"text_hash":"daa89849e72c30da1443a4e270aad91c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
