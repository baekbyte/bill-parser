Examples include dengue, leprosy, and rabies. The bill sets forth certain priorities for the NTDs Program of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), including the coordination of program activities with other USAID development sectors regarding (1) education; (2) food security; and (3) water, sanitation, and hygiene. The bill also directs the Department of State and the President to encourage foreign governments and international entities to address NTDs. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must take a series of actions relating to NTDs, including promoting initiatives in international forums and establishing a panel to address worm infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may award grants to support centers of excellence for research, training, and treatment regarding NTDs.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-17","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9493,"person_hash":"cabmgf99","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Roger Wicker","first_name":"Roger","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Wicker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MS","ftm_eid":17659028,"votesmart_id":21926,"opensecrets_id":"N00003280","knowwho_pid":158928,"ballotpedia":"Roger_Wicker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB826","sast_bill_id":1177713},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3460","sast_bill_id":1270263}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13682,"subject_name":"Africa"},{"subject_id":13871,"subject_name":"Argentina"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13957,"subject_name":"Brazil"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13605,"subject_name":"HIV\/AIDS"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13882,"subject_name":"India"},{"subject_id":13923,"subject_name":"Indonesia"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13235,"subject_name":"Latin America"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13243,"subject_name":"Mexico"},{"subject_id":13448,"subject_name":"Middle East"},{"subject_id":13849,"subject_name":"Multilateral development programs"},{"subject_id":13252,"subject_name":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":22815,"subject_name":"Pest management"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13462,"subject_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"subject_id":13963,"subject_name":"South Africa"},{"subject_id":13906,"subject_name":"South Korea"},{"subject_id":13450,"subject_name":"United Nations"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"},{"subject_id":13863,"subject_name":"World health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2055148,"date":"2019-09-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2481\/id\/2055148","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2481\/BILLS-116s2481is.pdf","text_size":377311,"text_hash":"0046592186ebc8043b637d753ef71a63"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
