Unlike the coverage options currently available on the exchange, which are administered by private insurance companies, this public option must be administered directly by HHS.The public option must comply with the same general requirements as other plan types available on the exchange, including with respect to available benefits, benefit levels, provider networks, notices, consumer protections, and cost sharing. Medicare health care providers are automatically participants in the public option unless they opt out, and providers not participating in Medicare may opt in. In addition, the bill establishes requirements for setting premiums, payment rates, and provider incentives.The bill appropriates funds to establish the public health insurance option, which HHS must repay over 10 years.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-01","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-01","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9034,"person_hash":"klgqsf3d","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter DeFazio","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"DeFazio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-4","ftm_eid":17658713,"votesmart_id":27037,"opensecrets_id":"N00007781","knowwho_pid":159029,"ballotpedia":"Peter_DeFazio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18295,"person_hash":"h6wxpim8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Salud Carbajal","first_name":"Salud","middle_name":"O.","last_name":"Carbajal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-24","ftm_eid":39707235,"votesmart_id":81569,"opensecrets_id":"N00037015","knowwho_pid":460424,"ballotpedia":"Salud_Carbajal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9309,"person_hash":"ro7scvdy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ed Perlmutter","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perlmutter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-7","ftm_eid":6276954,"votesmart_id":2653,"opensecrets_id":"N00027510","knowwho_pid":193129,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Perlmutter","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9076,"person_hash":"31giymui","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rick Larsen","first_name":"Rick","middle_name":"","last_name":"Larsen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-2","ftm_eid":17657616,"votesmart_id":56231,"opensecrets_id":"N00009759","knowwho_pid":124078,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Larsen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3","sast_bill_id":1137351}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13621,"subject_name":"Comprehensive health care"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1962267,"date":"2019-03-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1419\/id\/1962267","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1419\/BILLS-116hr1419ih.pdf","text_size":299303,"text_hash":"4a2db239ad81e1020515e18cd48f6707"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
