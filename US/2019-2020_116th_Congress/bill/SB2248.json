The program places personnel in (1) elementary and secondary schools that serve more than a certain percentage of lower-income students or those who qualify for aid under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and (2) Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded schools. The bill renames the program as the Troops-to-Support-Education Program and expands the positions covered to include a number of teaching support, administrative, and security personnel. Excluded from eligibility are positions performed outside the grounds of a school or for a contractor. For placement in non-teacher positions, the service member must obtain credentials required by the state in which the position is located. The bill increases the total number of stipends and bonuses provided. It also increases the limit on the amount of obligations for the program for each fiscal year. The Department of Defense may enter into partnership agreements with tax-exempt charitable organizations to assist with the placement of participants.","pending_committee_id":2320,"committee":{"committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-24","committee_id":2320,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Armed Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14889,"person_hash":"tc69v8nn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Steve Daines","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Daines","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7687176,"votesmart_id":135720,"opensecrets_id":"N00033054","knowwho_pid":378524,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Daines","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2500","sast_bill_id":1256454},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2869","sast_bill_id":1263706},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1790","sast_bill_id":1267965},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR758","sast_bill_id":1288053}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13283,"subject_name":"Special education"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047718,"date":"2019-07-31","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2248\/id\/2047718","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2248\/BILLS-116s2248is.pdf","text_size":368214,"text_hash":"be25e9042e62faafc33f4b25c70df622"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
