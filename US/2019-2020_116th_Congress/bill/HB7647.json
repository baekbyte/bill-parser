That rule allows private health insurance plans to decide whether support provided by a prescription drug manufacturer to cover a patient's costs for a drug counts toward the patient's annual out-of-pocket limit. The bill requires enforcement of the previous rule, which allows plans to exclude drug manufacturer support from a patient's annual out-of-pocket limit only if a generic version of the drug is available.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-16","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Education and Labor, and Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18322,"person_hash":"r0ntaemi","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Donald McEachin","first_name":"Donald","middle_name":"","last_name":"McEachin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-4","ftm_eid":5798194,"votesmart_id":8230,"opensecrets_id":"N00039327","knowwho_pid":199496,"ballotpedia":"Donald_McEachin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15206,"person_hash":"vn5bue1y","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rodney Davis","first_name":"Rodney","middle_name":"","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-13","ftm_eid":3054746,"votesmart_id":9622,"opensecrets_id":"N00034784","knowwho_pid":160440,"ballotpedia":"Rodney_Davis_(Illinois)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16485,"person_hash":"0vtl1zss","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bonnie Coleman","first_name":"Bonnie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-12","ftm_eid":6389632,"votesmart_id":24799,"opensecrets_id":"N00036158","knowwho_pid":362925,"ballotpedia":"Bonnie_Watson_Coleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18292,"person_hash":"c8kj8aoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lisa Rochester","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"Blunt","last_name":"Rochester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DE","ftm_eid":38420440,"votesmart_id":173249,"opensecrets_id":"N00038414","knowwho_pid":558891,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Blunt_Rochester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9137,"person_hash":"bhtcm97e","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bennie Thompson","first_name":"Bennie","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MS-2","ftm_eid":8348996,"votesmart_id":26929,"opensecrets_id":"N00003288","knowwho_pid":158929,"ballotpedia":"Bennie_Thompson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18333,"person_hash":"0akuuwt3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Thomas Suozzi","first_name":"Thomas","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Suozzi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-3","ftm_eid":12996931,"votesmart_id":92111,"opensecrets_id":"N00038742","knowwho_pid":462663,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Suozzi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
