The rate of the sales tax will be 23% in 2021, with adjustments to the rate in subsequent years. There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property; for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes; and for state government functions. Under the bill, family members who are lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate (Family Consumption Allowance) based upon criteria related to family size and poverty guidelines. The states have the responsibility for administering, collecting, and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury. Tax revenues are to be allocated among (1) the general revenue, (2) the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund, (3) the disability insurance trust fund, (4) the hospital insurance trust fund, and (5) the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund. No funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service after FY2023. Finally, the bill terminates the national sales tax if the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (authorizing an income tax) is not repealed within seven years after the enactment of this bill.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11100,"person_hash":"og0tyzub","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rob Woodall","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Woodall","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-7","ftm_eid":17657434,"votesmart_id":122251,"opensecrets_id":"N00032416","knowwho_pid":286515,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Woodall","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18288,"person_hash":"prykhtgd","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Banks","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Banks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-3","ftm_eid":2949733,"votesmart_id":116801,"opensecrets_id":"N00037185","knowwho_pid":291462,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Banks_(Indiana)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9209,"person_hash":"nnqnietk","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gus Bilirakis","first_name":"Gus","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Bilirakis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-12","ftm_eid":12998704,"votesmart_id":17318,"opensecrets_id":"N00027462","knowwho_pid":193559,"ballotpedia":"Gus_Bilirakis","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9243,"person_hash":"qfajed2l","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rob Bishop","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bishop","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-1","ftm_eid":15107372,"votesmart_id":50544,"opensecrets_id":"N00025292","knowwho_pid":211710,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Bishop","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11041,"person_hash":"5ix4efgl","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mo Brooks","first_name":"Mo","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brooks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AL-5","ftm_eid":6668470,"votesmart_id":121610,"opensecrets_id":"N00030910","knowwho_pid":283897,"ballotpedia":"Mo_Brooks","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9254,"person_hash":"qxy4osah","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Carter","first_name":"John","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Carter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-31","ftm_eid":17658461,"votesmart_id":49296,"opensecrets_id":"N00025095","knowwho_pid":211726,"ballotpedia":"John_Carter_(Texas)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11045,"person_hash":"u40pl0xx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Chabot","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chabot","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-1","ftm_eid":16571277,"votesmart_id":21790,"opensecrets_id":"N00003689","knowwho_pid":159001,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Chabot","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9177,"person_hash":"tryqw5x1","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Conaway","first_name":"K.
