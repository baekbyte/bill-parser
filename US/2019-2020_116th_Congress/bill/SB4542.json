However, HHS may waive the certification requirement and permit distribution outside of the United States if HHS makes a determination that such distribution would be in the interest of U.S. public health. A manufacturer that violates the requirement must reimburse the federal government for all amounts received by the manufacturer in support of development of the vaccine, plus interest.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-09","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-09","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2208321,"date":"2020-09-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4542\/id\/2208321","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4542\/BILLS-116s4542is.pdf","text_size":300185,"text_hash":"e2f52242ed9bbc110892b07313bef085"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
