Among other things, the bill reauthorizes appropriations through FY2023 for pipeline safety activities; prioritizes assessment methods for transmission pipelines that can provide a greater level of safety than direct assessment, including the use of internal inspection devices or pressure testing; makes it mandatory for each operator of a transmission pipeline facility in a high consequence area to install automatic or remote shutoff valves; directs owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to make critical operational information available to surrounding communities and first responders; increases civil penalties for violations and revises the criminal penalty standard from \"knowingly and willfully\" to \"knowingly or recklessly\"; and requires the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to submit an annual report to Congress detailing its efforts to hire women, minorities, and veterans as inspectors since January 1, 2012.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-24","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And
