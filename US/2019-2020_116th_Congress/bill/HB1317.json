Specifically, it revises the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. For example, the bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to award research and development grants under the program for the purpose of improving the resilience and responsiveness of buildings, structures, and lifelines to windstorms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must award capitalization grants to each coastal state for the purpose of establishing a community resilience revolving fund. In turn, states must provide financial assistance to municipalities or state agencies for preventing, managing, mitigating, or adapting to coastal hazards related to climate change. The Department of Commerce may carry out a program to award prizes to stimulate innovation to advance coastal risk reduction and resilience measures. The National Science Foundation must support research to improve (1) the resilience of buildings, structures, and lifelines to windstorms; and (2) the responsiveness of buildings, structures, and lifelines after a windstorm. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must promote the adoption of windstorm preparedness and mitigation measures for manufactured HUD code housing units. The U.S. Postal Service must issue a Built to Last stamp as a semipostal stamp. The proceeds from the stamp must be deposited in the Built to Last Stamp Fund established by this bill for shoreline risk and climate change adaptation.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and
