A drug manufacturer with over $1 billion in net income in a fiscal year that has entered into a relevant settlement agreement regarding specified violations must pay 0.75%-1.5% of its net income to the Department of Health and Human Services for each of its covered blockbuster drugs. A covered blockbuster drug is a drug that has at least $1 billion in net sales in a year and was developed, in whole or in part, through federal investments in medical research. Payments are divided between the FDA and the NIH in proportion to the discretionary funding of those agencies, excluding FDA user fees. Payments are not disbursed if appropriations for the FDA or the NIH are lower than in the prior fiscal year. Priorities for payments must include advancing regulatory science for medical products and research related to diseases that disproportionately account for federal health care spending. A covered blockbuster drug for which a manufacturer has not made a required payment is considered misbranded and subject to prohibitions on introducing or receiving misbranded drugs in interstate commerce.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-11-12","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3163","sast_bill_id":1299702}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13787,"subject_name":"Food and Drug Administration (FDA)"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13252,"subject_name":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2070462,"date":"2019-11-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5031\/id\/2070462","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5031\/BILLS-116hr5031ih.pdf","text_size":353962,"text_hash":"1dd070f652ea22c704106dec10dd3a8e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
