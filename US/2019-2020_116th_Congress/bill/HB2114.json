The bill authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide financial assistance to states for the implementation, review, and revision of a state energy security plan that assesses the state's existing circumstances and proposes methods to strengthen the ability of the state to have a reliable, secure, and resilient energy infrastructure. A state energy security plan must contain specified content, including a risk assessment of energy infrastructure and cross-sector interdependencies and a risk mitigation approach to enhance reliability and end-use resilience. The plan must address potential hazards to each energy sector or system, including physical threats and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. Upon request of a state, DOE may provide information and technical assistance, and other assistance, in the development, implementation, or revision of a state energy security plan. Each state that receives federal financial assistance must provide reasonable assurance to DOE that it has established policies and procedures designed to assure such assistance will increase and supplement, and not supplant, state and local funds.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-08","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},{"date":"2019-09-10","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Mr. Rush moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
