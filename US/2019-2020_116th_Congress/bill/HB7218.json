The Office of Foreign Assets Control shall take one or more specified actions relating to U.S. sanctions on North Korea, such as (1) expanding the current humanitarian exception to such sanctions to include items that meet basic human needs and are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or (2) exempting certain nonsensitive items for humanitarian operations from specific licensing requirements. For the purposes of such sanctions, personal computers for authorized humanitarian activities by nongovernmental organizations shall not be considered luxury goods. The Department of State shall direct the U.S. representative to the United Nations (UN) to urge the UN to (1) make it less burdensome for nongovernmental organizations to apply for humanitarian exemptions to UN sanctions on North Korea, and (2) speed up approval for such applications. The State Department shall devise a strategy to expedite and simplify the process for U.S. passport holders to obtain permission to travel to North Korea to provide humanitarian assistance.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-15","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20080,"person_hash":"i6yhkxol","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andy Levin","first_name":"Andy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Levin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-9","ftm_eid":6479763,"votesmart_id":66287,"opensecrets_id":"N00042149","knowwho_pid":646744,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Levin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20094,"person_hash":"8q0j3im4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ayanna Pressley","first_name":"Ayanna","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Pressley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-7","ftm_eid":45365104,"votesmart_id":122700,"opensecrets_id":"N00042581","knowwho_pid":234321,"ballotpedia":"Ayanna_Pressley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20090,"person_hash":"32tjrlyp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ilhan Omar","first_name":"Ilhan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Omar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-5","ftm_eid":40606750,"votesmart_id":171628,"opensecrets_id":"N00043581","knowwho_pid":583510,"ballotpedia":"Ilhan_Omar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20050,"person_hash":"xd7063do","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jason Crow","first_name":"Jason","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-6","ftm_eid":44044490,"votesmart_id":180218,"opensecrets_id":"N00040876","knowwho_pid":621716,"ballotpedia":"Jason_Crow","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3908","sast_bill_id":1369038}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20695,"subject_name":"Customs enforcement"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13613,"subject_name":"Foreign and international banking"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13692,"subject_name":"North Korea"},{"subject_id":13611,"subject_name":"Sanctions"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13658,"subject_name":"Technology transfer and commercialization"},{"subject_id":13416,"subject_name":"Trade restrictions"},{"subject_id":13533,"subject_name":"Travel and tourism"},{"subject_id":13450,"subject_name":"United Nations"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199481,"date":"2020-07-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7218\/id\/2199481","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7218\/BILLS-116hr7218ih.pdf","text_size":321626,"text_hash":"3144a3d4a347ef7e83e73806a4a1e991"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
