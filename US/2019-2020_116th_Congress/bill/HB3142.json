Specifically, the supplements (1) must provide at least half of the vitamins and minerals for which the National Academy of Medicine establishes dietary reference intakes at 50% or more of the daily value for the intended life stage per daily serving, as determined by the Food and Drug Administration; and (2) may not exceed the tolerable upper intake levels for those nutrients for which an established tolerable upper intake level is determined by the National Academy of Medicine. The bill amends the definition of \"staple food\" to exclude multivitamin-mineral dietary supplements.","pending_committee_id":4032,"committee":{"committee_id":4032,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-06-24","committee_id":4032,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9220,"person_hash":"ahue4yxo","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike D.
