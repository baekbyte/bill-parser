Specifically, the bill increases the national tribal economic development bond limitation to $4 billion. It also eliminates the requirement that TED bond proceeds be used solely on Indian reservations and permits bond proceeds to be used for economic development by any qualified Native user which includes any tribal entity, Alaska Native Corporation, and entity that is majority-owned and controlled by an Indian tribe or Alaska Native Corporation. The bill also allows third parties to guarantee the repayment of TED bonds.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-14","committee_id":4286,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-08-14","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9168,"person_hash":"c40vdlmx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Young","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AK","ftm_eid":17658637,"votesmart_id":26717,"opensecrets_id":"N00007999","knowwho_pid":158699,"ballotpedia":"Don_Young_(Alaska)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20112,"person_hash":"4cjgano2","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kim Schrier","first_name":"Kim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schrier","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-8","ftm_eid":44045231,"votesmart_id":181124,"opensecrets_id":"N00041606","knowwho_pid":632874,"ballotpedia":"Kim_Schrier","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8963,"person_hash":"lghvcrvx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kathy Castor","first_name":"Kathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Castor","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-14","ftm_eid":170335,"votesmart_id":53825,"opensecrets_id":"N00027514","knowwho_pid":248289,"ballotpedia":"Kathy_Castor","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15227,"person_hash":"yx3y1j2l","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ann Kuster","first_name":"Ann","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Kuster","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NH-2","ftm_eid":9794994,"votesmart_id":122256,"opensecrets_id":"N00030875","knowwho_pid":284835,"ballotpedia":"Annie_Kuster","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4333","sast_bill_id":1374702}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13780,"subject_name":"Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13763,"subject_name":"Community life and organization"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13193,"subject_name":"Gambling"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207372,"date":"2020-09-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8066\/id\/2207372","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8066\/BILLS-116hr8066ih.pdf","text_size":305151,"text_hash":"fc51a41090b30a38d82b803307fbe36c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
