Specifically, the FCC must collect and disseminate granular broadband service availability data (broadband maps) from wired, fixed-wireless, satellite, and mobile broadband providers. To do this, the FCC is required to establish the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric (a dataset of geocoded information for all broadband service locations, atop which broadband maps are overlaid) as the vehicle for reporting broadband service availability data. Additionally, the FCC must put forth specified requirements for service availability data collected from broadband providers, and it must create a challenge process to enable the submission of independent data challenging the accuracy of FCC broadband maps. The FCC must conduct regular audits of information submitted by providers, and it must develop a process whereby entities or individuals may submit information about the deployment and availability of broadband service to verify and supplement information submitted by providers. The FCC must also provide data collection and submission assistance to Indian tribes; small service providers; consumers; and state, local, and tribal governments. The Government Accountability Office must report on identified locations where fixed broadband can be installed to improve the quality and completeness of data sources for the fabric.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-12","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
