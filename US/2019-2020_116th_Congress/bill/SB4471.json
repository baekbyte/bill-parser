If a person takes an adverse action against a consumer based upon a housing court record contained in a credit report, the person must provide the consumer a free copy of the report. A person who willfully creates a credit report that contains an inaccurate housing record is civilly liable to the consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must (1) issue regulations that direct tenant rating agencies to create a central source for consumers to obtain reports and submit disputes, and (2) report on tenant rating agency compliance.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13606,"subject_name":"Judicial procedure and administration"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"},{"subject_id":13762,"subject_name":"Specialized courts"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207005,"date":"2020-09-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4471\/id\/2207005","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4471\/BILLS-116s4471is.pdf","text_size":306216,"text_hash":"e3a393c329d003d0ccbfac355d5de51f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
