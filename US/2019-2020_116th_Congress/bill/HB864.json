Specifically, it reclassifies certain wildlife-trafficking offenses and illegal fishing violations as violations of federal racketeering or other laws concerning transnational criminal organizations. The bill also expands federal law enforcement powers to combat wildlife trafficking (e.g., poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife). The bill sets forth requirements to provide awards to whistle-blowers for reporting violations of wildlife-trafficking laws. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service must carry out the International Wildlife Conservation Program to implement global habitat and conservation initiatives; address global conservation threats; combat wildlife trafficking, poaching, and trade in illegal wildlife products; and carry out international wildlife conservation and habitat activities authorized by federal law. Revenue generated from fines, penalties, or forfeitures of property or assets for certain wildlife and fishing violations may be used for a variety of animal conservation funds.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-30","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-15","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},{"date":"2019-03-25","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
