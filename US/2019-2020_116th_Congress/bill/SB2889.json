Specifically, the bill requires the Department of State to designate as a country of concern any country, including the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation, whose data privacy and security requirements pose a substantial risk to U.S. national security. A technology company that is subject to the jurisdiction of a country of concern and that provides a website or internet application operating in interstate or foreign commerce shall not collect unnecessary user data or use any user data for a purpose that is secondary to the operation of the website, service, or application; not transfer user data or information to a country of concern; not store user data on a server outside either the United States or a country that has agreed to share data with U.S. law enforcement agencies; and allow individuals to view and delete their individual user data. Additionally, any company that provides a website or internet application operating in interstate or foreign commerce but which is not subject to the jurisdiction of a country of concern is prohibited from transferring data to a country of concern or storing user data on a server located in a country of concern. The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce these requirements; however, the bill also provides for civil actions brought by either an individual or the attorney general of a state to enjoin the engagement of any person in a practice that violates the prohibitions in this bill.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-18","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13365,"subject_name":"Foreign and international corporations"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13664,"subject_name":"Photography and imaging"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13870,"subject_name":"Russia"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2070709,"date":"2019-11-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2889\/id\/2070709","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2889\/BILLS-116s2889is.pdf","text_size":350256,"text_hash":"b50f16f9e370f02e6cd4d94bd11c32df"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
