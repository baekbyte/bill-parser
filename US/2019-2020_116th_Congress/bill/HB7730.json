(VFR are a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going.) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must conduct a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate a new special air traffic rule for civil helicopters operating VFR along the North Shore and South Shore of Long Island, New York in accordance with specified requirements of the bill. A person who pilots a civil helicopter operating VFR along Long Island, New York's northern shoreline or southern shoreline may deviate from the North Shore Helicopter Route or South Shore Helicopter Route requirements: (1) for safety or weather conditions; or (2) when transitioning to or from a destination or point of landing, except for on the North Shore Helicopter Route when departing from or arriving to certain locations. If safety or weather conditions cause a person piloting a civil helicopter operating VFR to deviate from either route, the person must submit a one page report to the FAA identifying the condition not later than 14 days after landing.","pending_committee_id":2549,"committee":{"committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-22","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-07-23","committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-23","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Aviation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18333,"person_hash":"0akuuwt3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Thomas Suozzi","first_name":"Thomas","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Suozzi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-3","ftm_eid":12996931,"votesmart_id":92111,"opensecrets_id":"N00038742","knowwho_pid":462663,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Suozzi","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16491,"person_hash":"ypi61hrv","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kathleen Rice","first_name":"Kathleen","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Rice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-4","ftm_eid":6510977,"votesmart_id":127653,"opensecrets_id":"N00035927","knowwho_pid":489426,"ballotpedia":"Kathleen_Rice","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9283,"person_hash":"re1xha6c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter King","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-2","ftm_eid":17658227,"votesmart_id":26968,"opensecrets_id":"N00001193","knowwho_pid":158972,"ballotpedia":"Peter_King","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16482,"person_hash":"09m0eusv","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lee Zeldin","first_name":"Lee","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zeldin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-1","ftm_eid":6684704,"votesmart_id":110252,"opensecrets_id":"N00029404","knowwho_pid":267328,"ballotpedia":"Lee_Zeldin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4219","sast_bill_id":1373750}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13600,"subject_name":"New York City"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2204348,"date":"2020-08-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7730\/id\/2204348","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7730\/BILLS-116hr7730ih.pdf","text_size":305960,"text_hash":"46a94fde32b8911e7de6d3823956d43d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
