Specifically, each U.S. Executive Director at an international financial institution (e.g., the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the International Finance Corporation) must (1) seek the suspension of debt service payments to the institution and the relaxation of fiscal targets for certain programs, and (2) oppose programs or loan agreements that would reduce countries' health care spending or other spending related to their responses to COVID-19. Further, the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund must support the issuance of Special Drawing Rights (a currency support tool) so that governments may access additional resources to finance their responses to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-04-21","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-04-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-04-21","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
