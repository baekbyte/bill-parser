The bill requires an increase in the taxpayer's employment of full-time employees in the United States in order to claim the tax credit for insourcing expenses. The bill eliminates the temporary suspension (for taxable years 2018 through 2025) of the tax deduction for moving expenses.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
