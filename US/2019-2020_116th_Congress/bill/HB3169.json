Specifically, if a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer submits notification that it intends to carry out a fast-track recall plan, the CPSC must promptly post the notice on its website.The fast-track recall plan submitted to the CPSC must include (1) a clear product description, (2) a clear description of the safety risk being addressed, (3) how a consumer can obtain the available remedy, (4) a statement that such remedy will be provided at no charge, (5) the earliest date such remedy will be available, and (6) a schedule for notifying entities in the supply chain of the recall plan. For the purpose of related CPSC proceedings, however, filing a fast-track plan does not constitute an admission that the product is actually defective or presents a substantial hazard.Further, if the CPSC determines, after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that the remedy in the submitted fast-track plan is inadequate, it may order the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to take additional actions, including ceasing distribution, notification by mail, replacing the defective product, and accelerating the remedy.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-10","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-06-12","committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9193,"person_hash":"4p9iymg5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cathy McMorris Rodgers","first_name":"Cathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McMorris Rodgers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-5","ftm_eid":2941046,"votesmart_id":3217,"opensecrets_id":"N00026314","knowwho_pid":199779,"ballotpedia":"Cathy_McMorris_Rodgers","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18332,"person_hash":"fizx4b9o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darren Soto","first_name":"Darren","middle_name":"","last_name":"Soto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-9","ftm_eid":198924,"votesmart_id":67618,"opensecrets_id":"N00037422","knowwho_pid":255376,"ballotpedia":"Darren_Soto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19700,"person_hash":"ku74u6oh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Susan Wild","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wild","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-7","ftm_eid":17853601,"votesmart_id":178895,"opensecrets_id":"N00041997","knowwho_pid":638609,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Wild","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2038093,"date":"2019-06-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3169\/id\/2038093","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3169\/BILLS-116hr3169ih.pdf","text_size":248190,"text_hash":"cc0f50c88deb11552a8997e3ddf46015"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
