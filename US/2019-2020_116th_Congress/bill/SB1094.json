(Under current law, taxpayers who purchase a qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500, which begins to phase out once a manufacturer sells 200,000 qualified vehicles.) The bill allows an additional 400,000 vehicles per manufacturer to be eligible for a credit of up to $7,000 before the credit begins to phase out. The bill also extends the tax credit for fuel cell motor vehicles through 2028.

2017.)","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-09","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-09","action":"Read
