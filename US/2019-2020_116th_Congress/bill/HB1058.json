Specifically, the bill reauthorizes provisions relating to (1) expanded ASD research at the National Institutes of Health; (2) the collection of state-level ASD data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (3) ASD education, early detection, and intervention activities supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration; and (4) the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. The bill also generally revises the scope of such programs and activities to (1) encompass ASD individuals of all ages, rather than only youth; (2) focus funding on programs in areas with a shortage of personal health services; and (3) reduce health-outcome disparities across diverse populations.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-02-08","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-25","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee (Amended) by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
