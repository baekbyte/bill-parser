Specifically, if a Chapter 11 small business reorganization bankruptcy debtor is experiencing material financial hardship due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a court may extend the time the debtor may pay rent on a nonresidential real property from 60 days to 120 days. Additionally, businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic have an additional 90 days to determine whether to keep or end a nonresidential lease agreement. The bill also prohibits a bankruptcy trustee from voiding transfers of the debtor's interest due to the payment of certain rental and supplier arrearages. These provisions have a two-year sunset.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-06","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16524,"person_hash":"gt38jrsy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thom Tillis","first_name":"Thom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tillis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":5942566,"votesmart_id":57717,"opensecrets_id":"N00035492","knowwho_pid":250143,"ballotpedia":"Thom_Tillis_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13594,"subject_name":"Contracts and agency"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207071,"date":"2020-09-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4479\/id\/2207071","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4479\/BILLS-116s4479is.pdf","text_size":306785,"text_hash":"cdc8d70a1a4817ca657bc2c6f4d960bd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
