Specifically, the bill requires each federal agency (executive, legislative, and judicial) to allow eligible employees to telework full-time during the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). An employee is considered eligible if the employee has not received specified disciplinary action and is otherwise determined eligible by the agency. Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management must, in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services, develop an expansive telework policy for use in future outbreaks of infectious diseases. The bill also requires executive agencies to ensure that all new managers and supervisors receive certain training on specified aspects of telework, including the benefits of telework, the technology involved, and information security.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-10","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9141,"person_hash":"52gl0w7n","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chris Van Hollen","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Hollen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":5552236,"votesmart_id":6098,"opensecrets_id":"N00013820","knowwho_pid":195215,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Van_Hollen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11061,"person_hash":"r3ltpj5e","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Lankford","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lankford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-5","ftm_eid":17657561,"votesmart_id":124938,"opensecrets_id":"N00031129","knowwho_pid":284972,"ballotpedia":"James_Lankford","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15237,"person_hash":"dns9j2ob","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Krysten Sinema","first_name":"Krysten","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sinema","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":6459171,"votesmart_id":28338,"opensecrets_id":"N00033983","knowwho_pid":227495,"ballotpedia":"Kyrsten_Sinema","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13786,"subject_name":"Commuting"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207663,"date":"2020-09-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4518\/id\/2207663","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4518\/BILLS-116s4518is.pdf","text_size":302973,"text_hash":"299664d10d2e95eabd5a242b37899f71"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
