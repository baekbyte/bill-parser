The bill also establishes a rule regarding the organizational governance of mutual ditch or irrigation companies. Where state law provides that such a company may be organized in a manner that permits voting on a basis that is pro rata to share ownership on corporate governance matters, the tax-exempt status of the mutual ditch or irrigation company must be determined without taking into account whether its member shareholders have one vote on corporate governance matters per share held in the corporation.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-06","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11052,"person_hash":"aa3xvp5z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Gardner","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gardner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5988870,"votesmart_id":30004,"opensecrets_id":"N00030780","knowwho_pid":210102,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Gardner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9445,"person_hash":"f2k79x2t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Crapo","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crapo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":19890076,"votesmart_id":26830,"opensecrets_id":"N00006267","knowwho_pid":165218,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Crapo","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9482,"person_hash":"icw9uwys","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Pat Roberts","first_name":"Pat","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roberts","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KS","ftm_eid":16368473,"votesmart_id":26866,"opensecrets_id":"N00005285","knowwho_pid":165224,"ballotpedia":"Pat_Roberts","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9471,"person_hash":"61xtznm6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jon Tester","first_name":"Jon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7974707,"votesmart_id":20928,"opensecrets_id":"N00027605","knowwho_pid":196276,"ballotpedia":"Jon_Tester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9463,"person_hash":"ldf3b0fy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Michael Bennet","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Bennet","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5995587,"votesmart_id":110942,"opensecrets_id":"N00030608","knowwho_pid":274906,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Bennet","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9496,"person_hash":"gcopvn6m","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Risch","first_name":"James","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Risch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":6576171,"votesmart_id":2919,"opensecrets_id":"N00029441","knowwho_pid":213702,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Risch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9452,"person_hash":"zf1jqrq4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Michael Enzi","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Enzi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WY","ftm_eid":6651769,"votesmart_id":558,"opensecrets_id":"N00006249","knowwho_pid":165292,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Enzi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB807","sast_bill_id":1177749}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13492,"subject_name":"Farmland"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1926904,"date":"2019-02-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB361\/id\/1926904","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s361\/BILLS-116s361is.pdf","text_size":277603,"text_hash":"4558da92bb82dbd0218344e81e618576"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
