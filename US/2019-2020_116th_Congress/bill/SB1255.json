The regulations must (1) exclude from the driver's on-duty time certain activities, such as loading or unloading a commercial motor vehicle; (2) change the driving time requirement to a maximum of not less than 15, and not more than 18, hours within a 24-hour period; (3) permit the driver to take one or more rest periods during the trip, which shall not be included in the calculation of the driving time; (4) require the driver, after completion of the trip, to take a rest break for a period that is 5 hours less than the maximum driving time; (5) exclude from the calculation of the driving time any additional driving to the point of delivery if the driver is within 150 air-miles of the point of delivery; and (6) make inapplicable the requirement that the driver take a 10-hour rest period before driving.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And
