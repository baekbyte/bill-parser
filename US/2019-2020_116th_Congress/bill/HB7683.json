Commerce must issue regulations to establish criteria for whether a project directly or indirectly increases the accessibility of affordable, quality child care. Such criteria shall consider (1) the availability, validity, and accessibility of timely data, (2) the extent to which a project contributes to a family's financial security, and (3) the extent to which a project addresses child care needs in child care deserts or areas otherwise recognized as being in shortage. A child care desert is an area in which the number of children who are under age five is more than three times the number of slots provided by child care providers who are licensed or registered by the state involved, or a community that the state or tribal entity involved determines has a low supply of quality, affordable child care. Commerce must also issue guidance on how to include the accessibility of affordable, quality child care in a comprehensive economic development strategy.","pending_committee_id":4010,"committee":{"committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-20","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-07-21","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-21","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20058,"person_hash":"pwdv9ydm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abby Finkenauer","first_name":"Abby","middle_name":"","last_name":"Finkenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-1","ftm_eid":21098123,"votesmart_id":151127,"opensecrets_id":"N00040888","knowwho_pid":491276,"ballotpedia":"Abby_Finkenauer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20073,"person_hash":"td1vvwgg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Hagedorn","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hagedorn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-1","ftm_eid":24609149,"votesmart_id":146027,"opensecrets_id":"N00031390","knowwho_pid":284731,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Hagedorn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4383","sast_bill_id":1374906},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8326","sast_bill_id":1378556}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13152,"subject_name":"Department of Commerce"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2204306,"date":"2020-08-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7683\/id\/2204306","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7683\/BILLS-116hr7683ih.pdf","text_size":305535,"text_hash":"1c14a2b072bf13a777f0082058121f37"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
