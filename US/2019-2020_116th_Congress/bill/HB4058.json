The tax is equal to $30 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions beginning in 2021. The tax increases by 5% plus inflation each year and increases by $3 per ton every two years if the previous year's emission goals are not met. The revenue from such tax is divided (1) 70% for the reduction of payroll taxes; (2) 10% for additional payments to Social Security beneficiaries, and (3) 20% to establish a carbon trust fund for block grants to offset higher energy costs for low-income households, climate adaptation, energy efficiency, carbon sequestration, and research and development programs. The bill also amends the Clean Air Act to impose a 12-year moratorium on regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions. This moratorium may be lifted if certain emission targets are not met.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-07-26","committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-26","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18328,"person_hash":"jn7fz65i","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Francis Rooney","first_name":"Francis","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rooney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-19","ftm_eid":1486745,"votesmart_id":172678,"opensecrets_id":"N00040007","knowwho_pid":588424,"ballotpedia":"Francis_Rooney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4520","sast_bill_id":1275664}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13512,"subject_name":"Industrial facilities"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13785,"subject_name":"Metals"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048980,"date":"2019-08-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4058\/id\/2048980","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4058\/BILLS-116hr4058ih.pdf","text_size":441725,"text_hash":"d3d1a120594d26958b786f0fd43aa369"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
