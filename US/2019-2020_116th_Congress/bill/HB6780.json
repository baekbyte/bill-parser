In carrying out the pilot program, DOT must provide that an originating state may transfer or sell to a recipient state a credit not previously used by the originating state. DOT must also make available a public website on which originating states must post the amount of toll credits that are available for sale or transfer to a recipient state. DOT may terminate the pilot program or the participation of any state in the pilot program if the program is not serving a public benefit or it is not cost effective.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-05-11","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20091,"person_hash":"wl661lbn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Christopher Pappas","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Pappas","suffix":"","nickname":"Chris","district":"HD-NH-1","ftm_eid":6394987,"votesmart_id":42635,"opensecrets_id":"N00042161","knowwho_pid":213040,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Pappas","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20082,"person_hash":"tx2fp0ph","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Malinowski","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Malinowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-7","ftm_eid":44044869,"votesmart_id":179645,"opensecrets_id":"N00041843","knowwho_pid":495180,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Malinowski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2302","sast_bill_id":1272310}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2187367,"date":"2020-05-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6780\/id\/2187367","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6780\/BILLS-116hr6780ih.pdf","text_size":317910,"text_hash":"92c45128643276b93f75b11d3410f991"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
