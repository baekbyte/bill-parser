Among other things, debt collectors may not during such a period enforce a security interest through a repossession or foreclosure, commence or continue litigation to collect a debt, terminate utility service, seize assets, commence or continue an eviction, or charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment. After such a period, debt collectors must provide certain repayment options including extending the repayment period for debts. Violations of these provisions are subject to civil enforcement. The Federal Reserve Board must establish a facility to compensate financial institutions for losses caused by the suspension of payments.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-23","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14082,"person_hash":"7db3fndh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joyce Beatty","first_name":"Joyce","middle_name":"","last_name":"Beatty","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-3","ftm_eid":2954872,"votesmart_id":2427,"opensecrets_id":"N00033904","knowwho_pid":197852,"ballotpedia":"Joyce_Beatty","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9144,"person_hash":"ijja8k71","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Maxine Waters","first_name":"Maxine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-43","ftm_eid":1257359,"votesmart_id":26759,"opensecrets_id":"N00006690","knowwho_pid":158752,"ballotpedia":"Maxine_Waters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6379","sast_bill_id":1361588},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6361","sast_bill_id":1361562},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6321","sast_bill_id":1361595}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13808,"subject_name":"Alternative dispute resolution, mediation, arbitration"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":81071,"subject_name":"Debt collection"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13636,"subject_name":"Federal Reserve System"},{"subject_id":22689,"subject_name":"Foreign language and bilingual programs"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":327373,"subject_name":"Landlord and tenant"},{"subject_id":13355,"subject_name":"Postal service"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2178484,"date":"2020-04-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6332\/id\/2178484","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6332\/BILLS-116hr6332ih.pdf","text_size":327059,"text_hash":"edd71efda74425d3d824f6645a4f5076"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
