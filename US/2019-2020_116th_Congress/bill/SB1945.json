In addition, the bill requires the President to issue an individual determination and detailed justification for each proposal. Furthermore, such a determination shall be available for a proposal only if (1) the proposal directly responds to, or counters, a physical security threat; and (2) three-quarters of the arms will be delivered within two months.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-24","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-25","action":"Committee on Foreign Relations.
