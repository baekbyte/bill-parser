Specifically, the bill modifies the Women's Business Center Program to enable the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide initial and continuation grants to eligible entities to operate women's business centers for the benefit of women-owned small businesses. An entity must agree to obtain matching, non-federal funds, and the SBA must (1) ensure an applicant has sufficient resources to provide the services for which the grant is being made, and (2) conduct an annual compliance review. The SBA must also publish standards for a program to accredit entities that receive grants from the Women's Business Center Program, and such entities' receipt of continuation grants shall be contingent upon their obtaining accreditation.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-19","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},{"date":"2019-10-22","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Reported by the Committee on Small Business.
