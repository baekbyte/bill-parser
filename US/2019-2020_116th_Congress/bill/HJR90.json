The rule generally revises the office's implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which requires banks to serve the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. Under the CRA, a bank receives credit, which influences the bank's performance rating, for conducting specified activities related to this requirement in designated assessment areas. Among other things, the rule revises qualifying CRA activities, sets forth new procedures for determining if an activity qualifies under the CRA, and expands designated assessment areas.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-11","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-24","action":"Rules Committee Resolution H.
