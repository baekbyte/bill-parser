Specifically, within 30 days, HUD must distribute 50% of such funds to metropolitan cities and other units of local government and 50% to counties and parishes. Such funds may be used to cover costs or replace lost, delayed, or decreased revenues stemming from the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.In addition, the funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.","pending_committee_id":2319,"committee":{"committee_id":2319,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-06","committee_id":2319,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-06","action":"Read
