Specifically, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must implement a strategy to ensure chemical screening devices are able to identify narcotics at purity levels equal to or less than 10%, or provide an alternate method for identifying narcotics at lower purity levels. The CBP must also test new chemical screening devices at various purity levels before it commits to their acquisition. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must implement a plan for the long-term development of a centralized spectral database for chemical screening devices.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-04","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9444,"person_hash":"0ie58qto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cornyn","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cornyn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":6646197,"votesmart_id":15375,"opensecrets_id":"N00024852","knowwho_pid":211675,"ballotpedia":"John_Cornyn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18329,"person_hash":"jgkrx0ce","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jacky Rosen","first_name":"Jacky","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rosen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":39827617,"votesmart_id":169471,"opensecrets_id":"N00038734","knowwho_pid":567336,"ballotpedia":"Jacky_Rosen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9255,"person_hash":"8t4a6t34","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bill Cassidy","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cassidy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":6673315,"votesmart_id":69494,"opensecrets_id":"N00030245","knowwho_pid":266763,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Cassidy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18486,"person_hash":"8009qp8o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Margaret Hassan","first_name":"Margaret","middle_name":"Wood","last_name":"Hassan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":9693318,"votesmart_id":42552,"opensecrets_id":"N00038397","knowwho_pid":227982,"ballotpedia":"Maggie_Hassan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18413,"person_hash":"i8432eqr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Kennedy","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kennedy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-LA","ftm_eid":13010864,"votesmart_id":35496,"opensecrets_id":"N00026823","knowwho_pid":240389,"ballotpedia":"John_Neely_Kennedy","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4761","sast_bill_id":1277286}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":20692,"subject_name":"Chemistry"},{"subject_id":13429,"subject_name":"Crime prevention"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":20695,"subject_name":"Customs enforcement"},{"subject_id":13345,"subject_name":"Drug trafficking and controlled substances"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2124746,"date":"2020-02-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3250\/id\/2124746","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3250\/BILLS-116s3250is.pdf","text_size":319144,"text_hash":"15218ce70d67eeabcd793dbdb09f548c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
