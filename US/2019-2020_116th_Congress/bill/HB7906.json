In particular, the bill adds specificity to the circumstances under which DHS officers and agents may place individuals under arrest for a felony (without a warrant) in and around federal property. Among other requirements, an arrest must be based on probable cause and must occur on the federal property itself, in the immediate vicinity, or in an area that is covered by an agreement between DHS and another agency or state or local government; arrests may be made in other areas if part of an active pursuit. DHS officers and agents must also (1) display appropriate insignia and their full name while on duty, (2) identify themselves while making an arrest, and (3) inform the individual being arrested as to the cause of the arrest.","pending_committee_id":2315,"committee":{"committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-31","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9034,"person_hash":"klgqsf3d","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter DeFazio","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"DeFazio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-4","ftm_eid":17658713,"votesmart_id":27037,"opensecrets_id":"N00007781","knowwho_pid":159029,"ballotpedia":"Peter_DeFazio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9137,"person_hash":"bhtcm97e","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bennie Thompson","first_name":"Bennie","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MS-2","ftm_eid":8348996,"votesmart_id":26929,"opensecrets_id":"N00003288","knowwho_pid":158929,"ballotpedia":"Bennie_Thompson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9010,"person_hash":"wwcneni0","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Blumenauer","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-3","ftm_eid":4977792,"votesmart_id":367,"opensecrets_id":"N00007727","knowwho_pid":159028,"ballotpedia":"Earl_Blumenauer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":13869,"person_hash":"zwfqam9j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzanne Bonamici","first_name":"Suzanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bonamici","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-1","ftm_eid":339835,"votesmart_id":59641,"opensecrets_id":"N00033474","knowwho_pid":249764,"ballotpedia":"Suzanne_Bonamici","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8791","sast_bill_id":1383699}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13414,"subject_name":"Crimes against property"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13341,"subject_name":"Firearms and explosives"},{"subject_id":13196,"subject_name":"Government buildings, facilities, and property"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206114,"date":"2020-08-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7906\/id\/2206114","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7906\/BILLS-116hr7906ih.pdf","text_size":304942,"text_hash":"0fb451b944ee95c0ec7310ce7f9c3ffa"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
