An energy efficient residential rental property must be certified as being constructed, reconstructed, or retrofitted under a plan designed to reduce energy and power consumption of the building by at least 40% compared to (1) the baseline annual energy and power consumption of the building in the case of a retrofit made to an existing building, or (2) a reference building which meets the minimum requirements of the International Energy Conservation Code 2018 in any other case. The bill also (1) extends through 2020 the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction; and (2) eliminates the basis reduction requirements for certain low-income housing properties receiving the energy efficient home credit, the energy efficient commercial building deduction, or the credit for investments in energy property.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-12","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9075,"person_hash":"i5ao9u95","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Langevin","first_name":"James","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Langevin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-RI-2","ftm_eid":5029414,"votesmart_id":55787,"opensecrets_id":"N00009724","knowwho_pid":207711,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Langevin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13528,"subject_name":"Environmental technology"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":23053,"subject_name":"Lease and rental services"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053804,"date":"2019-09-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4317\/id\/2053804","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4317\/BILLS-116hr4317ih.pdf","text_size":361586,"text_hash":"7aa39bd1fb6e749e0d6b3a8e1da86b0c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
