In developing the pilot program, the TSA must address certain policies and procedures, including (1) accommodating individuals with disabilities or observing certain religious practices, and (2) exempting individuals who may have a fever unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. coronavirus disease 2019). The pilot program must ensure airlines allow passengers who are prohibited from flying due to a fever or a secondary medical screening to reschedule or cancel a flight at no cost. The TSA must, within 90 days after the completion of the pilot program, create a policy for deploying a temperature check program at airports and airport security screening locations through the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The Department of Transportation must revise its regulations to require the inclusion of certain information about traveling in the passenger notification system during the COVID-19 public health emergency, including (1) a message discouraging any individual who has a fever from traveling in air transportation, and (2) a notification that each passenger and any individual accompanying a passenger into the sterile area of the airport will undergo a temperature check if the pilot program established under this bill is in effect in that airport.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-17","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9427,"person_hash":"ajo63a1r","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Maria Cantwell","first_name":"Maria","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cantwell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":3465258,"votesmart_id":27122,"opensecrets_id":"N00007836","knowwho_pid":205537,"ballotpedia":"Maria_Cantwell","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20297,"person_hash":"9aqi5rh3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rick Scott","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"Rick","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":422306,"votesmart_id":124204,"opensecrets_id":"N00043290","knowwho_pid":289276,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8737","sast_bill_id":1382680}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13644,"subject_name":"Transportation costs"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2211472,"date":"2020-10-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4623\/id\/2211472","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4623\/BILLS-116s4623is.pdf","text_size":302288,"text_hash":"5d55a945890f932a3b933c8084e242c3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
