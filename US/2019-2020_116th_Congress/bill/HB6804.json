Specifically, the bill repeals provisions authorizing without a court order various types of searches and surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, including electronic surveillance and access to business records. An officer of the U.S. government must obtain a warrant for certain search and surveillance activities against a U.S. citizen, including (1) conducting electronic surveillance, (2) conducting physical searches of property under a U.S. citizen's exclusive control, or (3) targeting a U.S. citizen to acquire foreign intelligence information. The bill provides for criminal penalties for a person who knowingly violates these requirements or otherwise obtains such information under color of law without statutory authorization. Information about a U.S. citizen acquired under Executive Order 12333 (relating to intelligence gathering) or during surveillance of a non-U.S. citizen shall not be used against the U.S. citizen in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding or investigation.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-12","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Intelligence (Permanent Select), for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-12","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Intelligence (Permanent Select), for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18291,"person_hash":"3fg4gjfb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andy Biggs","first_name":"Andy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Biggs","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-5","ftm_eid":6602301,"votesmart_id":28088,"opensecrets_id":"N00039293","knowwho_pid":212155,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Biggs","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13467,"subject_name":"Evidence and witnesses"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13445,"subject_name":"Jurisdiction and venue"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2191121,"date":"2020-06-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6804\/id\/2191121","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6804\/BILLS-116hr6804ih.pdf","text_size":313421,"text_hash":"6a894944a9f65edc41e51adc9dbb8260"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
