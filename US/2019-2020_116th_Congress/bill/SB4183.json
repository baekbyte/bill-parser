First, the bill requires a covered organization (e.g., corporation, labor organization, or political committee) that spends more than $50,000 in a calendar year on federal judicial nomination communications to file a statement with the Federal Election Commission. Further, the bill outlines the timing requirements for the statement and its required contents, including the disclosure of certain donors. Next, the bill requires federal judicial nomination communications to contain disclaimers that identify the person who funded the communication. Finally, it prohibits foreign nationals and foreign-influenced corporations from funding a federal judicial nomination communication.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-02","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-02","action":"Read
