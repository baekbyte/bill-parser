Under current law, the PSLF program forgives the balance of a borrower's student debt after the borrower makes 120 qualifying loan payments under specified repayment plans while employed in a public service job. The bill expands the program to include payments under graduated or extended plans as payments that qualify a borrower for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. The bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to provide each borrower who has submitted a certification of employment under the PSLF program with a notification related to changes made to the program and a calculation of the borrower's monthly payments that count toward loan forgiveness. It also requires ED to establish a dispute resolution process.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-11","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9443,"person_hash":"jgbb1oef","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sheldon Whitehouse","first_name":"Sheldon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Whitehouse","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-RI","ftm_eid":373538,"votesmart_id":2572,"opensecrets_id":"N00027533","knowwho_pid":248425,"ballotpedia":"Sheldon_Whitehouse","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15418,"person_hash":"0wvwru9t","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Kaine","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kaine","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":5743146,"votesmart_id":50772,"opensecrets_id":"N00033177","knowwho_pid":140385,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Kaine","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13154,"subject_name":"Department of Education"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13342,"subject_name":"Lawyers and legal services"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13752,"subject_name":"Preschool education"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2003740,"date":"2019-04-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1175\/id\/2003740","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1175\/BILLS-116s1175is.pdf","text_size":303454,"text_hash":"3c0bad79e26815a0d12ba23706909e85"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
