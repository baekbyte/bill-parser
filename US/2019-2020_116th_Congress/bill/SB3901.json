Specifically, the National Science Foundation must establish criteria to designate qualified institutions of higher education (IHEs) as eligible to participate in the program. Such criteria must include (1) measures of an IHE's demonstrated excellence in the education of students in AI; and (2) measures of an IHE's ability to attract and retain a diverse and nontraditional student population in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Further, the program must (1) provide scholarships through qualified IHEs to students who are enrolled in programs of study related to AI, (2) provide scholarship recipients with internship opportunities, (3) prioritize the employment placement of scholarship recipients in executive agencies, (4) identify opportunities to promote multidisciplinary programs of study that integrate basic or advanced AI training with other fields of study, and (5) support education research programs to train AI researchers and practitioners. Additionally, the post-award employment obligations of a scholarship recipient must include three years of work for an executive agency; Congress; an interstate agency; a state, local, or tribal government; or a government-affiliated nonprofit that is considered to be critical infrastructure. A scholarship recipient who completes less than the required three years of service must repay the scholarship, or the scholarship must be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan that is subject to repayment.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-04","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9107,"person_hash":"n0hm1fke","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gary Peters","first_name":"Gary","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-14","ftm_eid":363232,"votesmart_id":8749,"opensecrets_id":"N00029277","knowwho_pid":195614,"ballotpedia":"Gary_Peters","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11052,"person_hash":"aa3xvp5z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Gardner","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gardner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5988870,"votesmart_id":30004,"opensecrets_id":"N00030780","knowwho_pid":210102,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Gardner","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13655,"subject_name":"Science and engineering education"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199557,"date":"2020-07-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3901\/id\/2199557","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3901\/BILLS-116s3901is.pdf","text_size":319558,"text_hash":"d93458c8cae7aa72c2f604a66d6ed9ae"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
