Specifically, the bill authorizes USDA to approve state agency plans to provide SNAP benefits to households that include at least one eligible child and may or may not be participating in SNAP. An eligible child is a child who would be receiving free or reduced-price school meals if the child's school had not been closed for at least five consecutive days due to the public health emergency based on COVID-19. SNAP benefits provided must be no less than the value of school meals at the federal free rate over the course of five school days for each eligible child in the household. A state agency may provide SNAP benefits in accordance with the bill through the electronic benefits transfer card system.","pending_committee_id":2297,"committee":{"committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-11","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9045,"person_hash":"mcq0g6jm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Marcia Fudge","first_name":"Marcia","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Fudge","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-11","ftm_eid":14904741,"votesmart_id":110640,"opensecrets_id":"N00030490","knowwho_pid":271756,"ballotpedia":"Marcia_Fudge","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9127,"person_hash":"yj5zsql5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Scott","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"Bobby","district":"HD-VA-3","ftm_eid":17658728,"votesmart_id":173269,"opensecrets_id":"N00002147","knowwho_pid":159106,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Scott_(Delaware)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20069,"person_hash":"bfp27mah","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jahana Hayes","first_name":"Jahana","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hayes","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":45681143,"votesmart_id":181744,"opensecrets_id":"N00043421","knowwho_pid":666101,"ballotpedia":"Jahana_Hayes","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6201","sast_bill_id":1359175}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175007,"date":"2020-03-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6200\/id\/2175007","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6200\/BILLS-116hr6200ih.pdf","text_size":318854,"text_hash":"499f87bb41dda4166495ac2b0e34e4b0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
