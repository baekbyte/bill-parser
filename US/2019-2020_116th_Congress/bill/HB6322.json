Specifically, the bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to continue paying work-study allowances during emergency periods. The VA is also authorized to continue paying educational assistance and subsistence allowances for a specified amount of time for programs of education that are suspended due to an emergency situation. An educational assistance payment shall not be charged against an individual's entitlement to educational assistance if an individual was unable to complete a course or program due to the temporary closure of an educational institution or the temporary termination of a program by reason of an emergency situation. This includes assistance related to training and rehabilitation programs for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The bill extends the time limitation for using educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9\/11 GI Bill when institutions are closed due to an emergency situation or executive order. The bill also extends the time limitation for participation in a vocational rehabilitation program when such participation is prevented due to an emergency situation or executive order. The bill authorizes the VA to pay a subsistence allowance for two additional months to a veteran following a program of employment services during the covered period for full-time training for the type of program the veteran was pursuing.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-23","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-31","action":"Without objection, the Chair laid before the House H.R. 6322 with an amendment.
