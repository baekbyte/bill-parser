The bill generally prohibits individuals, political committees, and other entities from distributing with actual malice any materially deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate within 60 days of a federal election with the intent to (1) injure the candidate's reputation, or (2) deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate. Such prohibition does not apply to (1) audio or visual media containing certain disclosures (e.g., verbal or written statements); or (2) certain entities, such as radio or television broadcasting stations that broadcast such media with disclosures as part of a bona fide newscast. Additionally, the bill establishes a new criminal offense related to the distribution of materially deceptive audio or visual media prior to a federal election. A violator is subject to a fine, up to 5 years in prison, or both. It also permits a candidate whose voice or likeness appears in such deceptive audio or visual media to bring a civil action for damages.","pending_committee_id":2307,"committee":{"committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-04","committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9085,"person_hash":"6nc2hqqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Stephen Lynch","first_name":"Stephen","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Lynch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-8","ftm_eid":1819740,"votesmart_id":4844,"opensecrets_id":"N00013855","knowwho_pid":195035,"ballotpedia":"Stephen_Lynch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16492,"person_hash":"c0i0lq89","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark DeSaulnier","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"DeSaulnier","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-11","ftm_eid":24686,"votesmart_id":69477,"opensecrets_id":"N00030709","knowwho_pid":248434,"ballotpedia":"Mark_DeSaulnier","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9027,"person_hash":"5fj074kg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Cooper","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cooper","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-5","ftm_eid":17658367,"votesmart_id":48891,"opensecrets_id":"N00003132","knowwho_pid":211701,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Cooper_(Tennessee)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4617","sast_bill_id":1276509}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13344,"subject_name":"Criminal procedure and sentencing"},{"subject_id":13887,"subject_name":"Digital media"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13664,"subject_name":"Photography and imaging"},{"subject_id":13515,"subject_name":"Political advertising"},{"subject_id":13761,"subject_name":"Sound recording"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2166523,"date":"2020-03-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6088\/id\/2166523","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6088\/BILLS-116hr6088ih.pdf","text_size":335091,"text_hash":"aa9dbc55799cb8f048e0fb1eb30d76de"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
