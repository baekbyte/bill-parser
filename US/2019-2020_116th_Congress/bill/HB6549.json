Further, a lender may not consider such a loan for purposes of determining whether the lender has the right to accelerate the due date of any loan agreement. In addition, until two years after the termination of the COVID-19 national emergency, the bill (1) declares it to be U.S. policy that lenders should not accelerate due dates for any business loans or curtail any lines of credit, and (2) releases from liability a trustee that decides not to enforce a loan covenant that accelerates repayment under a loan agreement or reduces the availability of funds under a line of credit.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-04-17","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-04-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-04-17","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8989,"person_hash":"qrk1gvtk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brad Sherman","first_name":"Brad","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sherman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-30","ftm_eid":369166,"votesmart_id":142,"opensecrets_id":"N00006897","knowwho_pid":158741,"ballotpedia":"Brad_Sherman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2180127,"date":"2020-04-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6549\/id\/2180127","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6549\/BILLS-116hr6549ih.pdf","text_size":314129,"text_hash":"e99c6ed169376a4cf493f6dc9d721e94"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
