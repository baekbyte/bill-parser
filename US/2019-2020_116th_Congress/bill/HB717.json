Specifically, this bill makes it unlawful for a licensed gun dealer, importer, manufacturer, or collector to sell or deliver a semiautomatic center-fire rifle that has the capacity to accept more than five rounds to an individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under age 21. The prohibition does not apply if the individual under age 21 is a full-time law enforcement officer or active-duty member of the Armed Forces. The bill also requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report on the operation of its public access line, including a description of information sharing protocols and recommendations for improving such protocols.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-23","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-03-04","committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18293,"person_hash":"vidnqcls","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brown","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-4","ftm_eid":5017996,"votesmart_id":19344,"opensecrets_id":"N00036999","knowwho_pid":195317,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16271,"person_hash":"jlk6q4zn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alma Adams","first_name":"Alma","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-12","ftm_eid":5890773,"votesmart_id":5935,"opensecrets_id":"N00035451","knowwho_pid":196595,"ballotpedia":"Alma_Adams","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18292,"person_hash":"c8kj8aoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lisa Rochester","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"Blunt","last_name":"Rochester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DE","ftm_eid":38420440,"votesmart_id":173249,"opensecrets_id":"N00038414","knowwho_pid":558891,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Blunt_Rochester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16487,"person_hash":"v3itu924","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brendan Boyle","first_name":"Brendan","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Boyle","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-13","ftm_eid":13006066,"votesmart_id":47357,"opensecrets_id":"N00035307","knowwho_pid":269627,"ballotpedia":"Brendan_Boyle","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
