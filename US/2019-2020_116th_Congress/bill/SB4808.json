Specifically, the bill establishes a noninterference standard that provides U.S. international broadcasting with the expectation that other U.S. government agencies or officials shall not interfere with its journalists. It also requires the Department of State and the Broadcast Board of Governors to (1) respect the professional independence and integrity of the USAGM, its broadcasting services, and its grantees; (2) protect USAGM journalists from undue interference by U.S. government agencies or officials; and (3) ensure that USAGM employees are judged solely on the basis of their adherence to professional standards of broadcast journalism. Further, the bill requires the Inspector General of the State Department and the Foreign Service to investigate any potential infringements to journalistic independence by senior USAGM officials or other federal officials.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-19","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8986,"person_hash":"m2pvngcc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Murphy","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Murphy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":6384200,"votesmart_id":17189,"opensecrets_id":"N00027566","knowwho_pid":193324,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13615,"subject_name":"International exchange and broadcasting"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13592,"subject_name":"Political parties and affiliation"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":332087,"subject_name":"U.S. Agency for Global Media"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213744,"date":"2020-10-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4808\/id\/2213744","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4808\/BILLS-116s4808is.pdf","text_size":293718,"text_hash":"f285aa699096575faf30fe3b1dc3ccba"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
