During the period beginning on February 1, 2020, and ending January 31, 2021, the bill allows for virtual home visits; prohibits reductions in funding for, or staffing of, entities that implement the home visits due to reduced enrollment of families in the program; and expands the permitted uses of program funds to include, among others, providing families with resources to support their participation in virtual visits. The bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to delay deadlines for requirements of the home visiting programs.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-14","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9032,"person_hash":"fem2kor1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Danny Davis","first_name":"Danny","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-7","ftm_eid":16565454,"votesmart_id":233,"opensecrets_id":"N00004884","knowwho_pid":158834,"ballotpedia":"Danny_K._Davis","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8963,"person_hash":"lghvcrvx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kathy Castor","first_name":"Kathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Castor","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-14","ftm_eid":170335,"votesmart_id":53825,"opensecrets_id":"N00027514","knowwho_pid":248289,"ballotpedia":"Kathy_Castor","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6379","sast_bill_id":1361588},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6800","sast_bill_id":1365578}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":327521,"subject_name":"Cosmetics and personal care"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13216,"subject_name":"Home and outpatient care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2192148,"date":"2020-06-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6865\/id\/2192148","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6865\/BILLS-116hr6865ih.pdf","text_size":309229,"text_hash":"2fc5b7599b4a1163870a20fb78e70a31"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
