The FNS must provide grants to community colleges that reflect varying (1) student body size; (2) full-time student enrollment; (3) geographic location, including urban, rural, or suburban campuses; (4) minority serving institutions; and (5) residential character, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The FNS may give priority to community colleges (1) with prepared food infrastructure, or those that can identify outside sources of support to help develop such infrastructure; (2) that serve more than 300 students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants; or (3) that are located within proximity of a school in a high poverty area that receives special assistance payments under the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
