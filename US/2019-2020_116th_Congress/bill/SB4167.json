Specifically, the bill authorizes an additional disaster loan to a prior recipient that received such a loan during the period between February 15, 2020, and December 31, 2020, up to an aggregate amount of $2 million. Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan; rather, the SBA shall only consider the financial need and ability of the applicant to repay. The bill also authorizes a recipient of such additional lending to request an additional advance, up to an aggregate amount of $10,000. A recipient that suffered a decline in revenue of not less than 50% between March 2, 2020, and December 31, 2020, may request an advance of not more than $25,000. Further, the interest rate for any economic injury disaster loan made between February 15, 2020, and December 31, 2020, shall not exceed 1%. Any amounts made available to provide loans under the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that are unobligated as of August 8, 2020, shall be made available for SBA disaster loans.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-02","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15348,"person_hash":"ov53d9s8","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Angus King","first_name":"Angus","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"King","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":1792907,"votesmart_id":22381,"opensecrets_id":"N00034580","knowwho_pid":209655,"ballotpedia":"Angus_King","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13275,"subject_name":"Small Business Administration"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2201602,"date":"2020-07-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4167\/id\/2201602","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4167\/BILLS-116s4167is.pdf","text_size":306107,"text_hash":"6df466152d5bda2c5def8be9059bbb5e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
