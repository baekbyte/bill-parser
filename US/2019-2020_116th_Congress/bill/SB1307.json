The Department of Agriculture (USDA) must identify, for optional use in LEAs on or near Indian reservations, alternatives to current program requirements related to the daily counting of meals by category, the use of annual applications to determine program eligibility, and the use of universal meal service. USDA may implement such alternatives, as limited by the bill, as well as further test them in demonstration projects. The bill also requires USDA to increase the amount of administrative funds paid to an Indian tribe that agrees to assume responsibility for the administration of one of the specified food programs.","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-02","committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9472,"person_hash":"4c2m8lz3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Udall","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Udall","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NM","ftm_eid":1864753,"votesmart_id":22658,"opensecrets_id":"N00006561","knowwho_pid":158967,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Udall","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18329,"person_hash":"jgkrx0ce","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jacky Rosen","first_name":"Jacky","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rosen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":39827617,"votesmart_id":169471,"opensecrets_id":"N00038734","knowwho_pid":567336,"ballotpedia":"Jacky_Rosen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2494","sast_bill_id":1256516}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13874,"subject_name":"Adult day care"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2017539,"date":"2019-05-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1307\/id\/2017539","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1307\/BILLS-116s1307is.pdf","text_size":334348,"text_hash":"f65f8e7e637d1990ac2a787dac12a4a4"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
