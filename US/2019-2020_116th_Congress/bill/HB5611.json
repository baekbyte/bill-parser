Each local educational agency must develop and implement a standard plan for concussion safety and management that includes (1) the education of students, parents, and school personnel about concussions; (2) specified supports for each student recovering from a concussion; and (3) best practices designed to ensure the uniformity of safety standards, treatment, and management. Each public school must post on school grounds and publish on the school website specified information about concussions. If any public school personnel suspects that a student has sustained a concussion during a school-sponsored activity, the student must be immediately removed from participation in that activity and prohibited from participating in any school-sponsored athletic activities until the student submits a written release from a health care professional. Furthermore, the school personnel must report all available information regarding the injury to a concussion management team that will confirm and report details of the injury to the student's parents. The school's concussion management team shall consult with and make recommendations to relevant school personnel and the student to ensure that the student is receiving the appropriate academic supports.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-15","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16492,"person_hash":"c0i0lq89","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark DeSaulnier","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"DeSaulnier","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-11","ftm_eid":24686,"votesmart_id":69477,"opensecrets_id":"N00030709","knowwho_pid":248434,"ballotpedia":"Mark_DeSaulnier","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20108,"person_hash":"1zy2f82t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Pete Stauber","first_name":"Pete","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stauber","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-8","ftm_eid":44044791,"votesmart_id":159954,"opensecrets_id":"N00041511","knowwho_pid":630211,"ballotpedia":"Pete_Stauber","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6007","sast_bill_id":1352811},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3347","sast_bill_id":1352797}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13436,"subject_name":"Neurological disorders"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13702,"subject_name":"School athletics"},{"subject_id":13283,"subject_name":"Special education"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2104416,"date":"2020-01-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5611\/id\/2104416","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5611\/BILLS-116hr5611ih.pdf","text_size":335862,"text_hash":"dd43f2dc444c5df8bc244d0299aa79d5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
