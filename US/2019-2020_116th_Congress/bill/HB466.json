Specifically, the bill prohibits a private land-use restriction from being applied to an amateur radio service if such restriction precludes amateur radio service communications, prevents an amateur radio service from installing an outdoor antenna on property under the exclusive use or control of the radio service, or imposes more than the minimum practicable restriction on amateur radio communications. The bill requires an amateur radio service to obtain prior approval from a community association before installing an outdoor antenna and allows an association to establish reasonable installation rules for outdoor antennas.","pending_committee_id":2358,"committee":{"committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-10","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11060,"person_hash":"g4hq688c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adam Kinzinger","first_name":"Adam","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kinzinger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-16","ftm_eid":17657449,"votesmart_id":116559,"opensecrets_id":"N00030667","knowwho_pid":284452,"ballotpedia":"Adam_Kinzinger","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9029,"person_hash":"2qvf13k9","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joe Courtney","first_name":"Joe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Courtney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-2","ftm_eid":7236851,"votesmart_id":30333,"opensecrets_id":"N00024842","knowwho_pid":248833,"ballotpedia":"Joe_Courtney","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9335,"person_hash":"izjd30j2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Greg Walden","first_name":"Greg","middle_name":"","last_name":"Walden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-2","ftm_eid":3106417,"votesmart_id":2979,"opensecrets_id":"N00007690","knowwho_pid":159027,"ballotpedia":"Greg_Walden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13137,"subject_name":"Broadcasting, cable, digital technologies"},{"subject_id":13634,"subject_name":"Federal Communications Commission (FCC)"},{"subject_id":13185,"subject_name":"Federal preemption"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1878913,"date":"2019-01-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB466\/id\/1878913","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr466\/BILLS-116hr466ih.pdf","text_size":129588,"text_hash":"fb4c5c0c6c8c9726b6374936c79c8ffe"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
