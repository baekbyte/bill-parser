An employee who is eligible but not enrolled may enroll in an employer-provided group health plan during the special enrollment period.The bill also requires such plans to cover services related to the disease or condition resulting in the public health emergency including, if applicable, vaccines, diagnostic testing, and treatment and care for the disease or condition. Such coverage does not require a positive diagnosis of the disease or condition and cost sharing must be comparable to similar services covered outside the circumstance of a public health emergency.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-19","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-19","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9460,"person_hash":"glri16zi","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jack Reed","first_name":"Jack","middle_name":"","last_name":"Reed","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-RI","ftm_eid":5584992,"votesmart_id":27060,"opensecrets_id":"N00000362","knowwho_pid":165269,"ballotpedia":"Jack_Reed","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6317","sast_bill_id":1361577}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177801,"date":"2020-04-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3536\/id\/2177801","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3536\/BILLS-116s3536is.pdf","text_size":328566,"text_hash":"856d9a3ae0061385797ec55aa709da8a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
