American Citizen Services are the range of services provided by the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, such as emergency passports, consular reports of birth abroad, emergency financial assistance, and repatriation. The State Department must petition the government of any country that closes borders and airspace or establishes travel restrictions due to COVID-19 to make provisions with the appropriate U.S. consular service in that country to ensure U.S. citizens, nationals, lawful permanent residents, or the immediate family members of such persons can travel to U.S. government evacuation points or access commercial travel. The State Department must also waive or reimburse certain repatriation travel expenses incurred due to COVID-19. Further, the State Department must provide U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic missions with explicit guidance to protect American lives abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic, increase certain consular affairs staffing, develop a comprehensive plan for COVID-19 infection risk mitigation procedures for all persons under chief of mission authority at overseas posts, regularly report on the Bureau of Consular Affairs' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and prioritize regular and continued hiring of Foreign Service officers and specialists.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-22","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6595","sast_bill_id":1363529}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13644,"subject_name":"Transportation costs"},{"subject_id":13533,"subject_name":"Travel and tourism"},{"subject_id":13527,"subject_name":"Visas and passports"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"},{"subject_id":13863,"subject_name":"World health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2200080,"date":"2020-07-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4026\/id\/2200080","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4026\/BILLS-116s4026is.pdf","text_size":316582,"text_hash":"07f35463c99f46e798af5e9c33747f0e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
