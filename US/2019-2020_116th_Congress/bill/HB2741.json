The bill provides support for communication infrastructure, such as funding to expand broadband internet access, or implement next generation 9-1-1 systems. In addition, the bill reauthorizes the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund through FY2024 and provides support for drinking water infrastructure, including support to: (1) remove and replace sources of lead in drinking water; or (2) treat drinking water contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. The bill also provides support for energy infrastructure, including support for: (1) the electric grid (e.g., grid modernization, security, resiliency, or efficiency); (2) energy efficiency measures (e.g., programs to promote energy efficiency in buildings); (3) energy supply (e.g., efforts to ensure the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is operated and maintained in an environmentally sound manner); or (4) renewable energy (e.g., solar installations in low-income and underserved areas). It also reauthorizes the Diesel Emissions Reductions Act as well as the Weatherization Assistance Program through FY2024. Finally, the bill provides support for health care infrastructure, including funding for hospitals, laboratories, or community-based
