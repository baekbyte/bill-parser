Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to establish a comprehensive database identifying each qualified public service employer and each position offered by such employer that is a public service job. ED must also establish a process whereby an employer may submit a certification that it is a qualified public service employer. In addition, the bill prohibits ED from requiring a borrower to apply for and be denied loan cancellation pursuant to the public service loan forgiveness program as a condition of eligibility for loan forgiveness under the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. ED must also develop and make publicly available an online tool where borrowers may learn more about the expanded program, determine their eligibility for forgiveness, and identify any requirements for participation.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
