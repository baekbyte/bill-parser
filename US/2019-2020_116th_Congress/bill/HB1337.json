The bill also requires the EPA to cancel the registrations of any pesticides containing imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, dinotefuran, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, flupyradifurone, or fipronil until the board has made a determination that such insecticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators based on findings that include results of studies of neonicotinoids and the effects of residues, repeated applications, and multiple chemical exposures. Under the bill, the EPA shall not issue any new registrations for any seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee-attractive plants, trees, and cereals until the board has made determinations on such insecticides. The bill requires the Department of the Interior, the EPA, and the Department of Agriculture to coordinate monitoring activities and report on the health and population status of native bees and other pollinators. The bill prohibits unregistered uses of pesticides by a federal or state agency to address emergency conditions except (1) to avert significant risk to threatened or endangered species, (2) to quarantine invasive species, or (3) to protect public health.","pending_committee_id":3245,"committee":{"committee_id":3245,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-25","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-03-13","committee_id":3245,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-25","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
