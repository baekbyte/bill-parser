Specifically, the bill adds new definitions, including a definition of hunter recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment; apportions to states revenues from taxes on pistols, revolvers, bows, and arrows at a rate not greater than 3% and not less than 1% of such revenues; removes the existing prohibition in the Act on public relations to allow spending by states for management of wildlife areas and promotion of hunting and recreational shooting; allows the use of grant funds for the enhancement of hunter recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment; and expands the Multistate Conservation Grant program by providing $5 million exclusively for making hunter and recreational shooter recruitment project grants that promote a national hunting and shooting sport recruitment program, including related communication and outreach activities. The Fish and Wildlife Service shall review and evaluate the effects of funds used for hunter and recreational shooter recruitment on funds available for wildlife conservation.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-30","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-15","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-15","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-26","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-05","action":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-05","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-05","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Unanimous Consent.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-08","action":"Reported by the Committee on Natural Resources.
