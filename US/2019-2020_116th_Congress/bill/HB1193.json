Funds may be used for such a national emergency for only 60 days. The House of Representatives or the Senate may not consider a bill or joint resolution that makes funds available in violation of these provisions. The President shall, in the case of such introduction of the Armed Forces, submit to Congress a report that includes an analysis of the threat to be countered by the use of the Armed Forces; the specific objectives and justification for those objectives; and a description of the scope, duration, cost, and likelihood of
