Specifically, it requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to seek an agreement with the American Red Cross for the conduct of a pilot program to encourage new Armed Forces members to designate up to 15 persons with whom certain information regarding their military service would be shared. This includes information concerning aspects of daily life in the military and its challenges, particularly during and after deployment in a contingency operation; availability of services to help members and dependents to cope with experiences; and benefits provided by DOD. The bill provides privacy protections and mechanisms to modify the contact information or opt out of the program.","pending_committee_id":2361,"committee":{"committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-14","committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"},{"date":"2019-05-15","committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15235,"person_hash":"mdfdtnth","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Peters","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Peters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-52","ftm_eid":14148706,"votesmart_id":70351,"opensecrets_id":"N00033591","knowwho_pid":378729,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Peters","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18288,"person_hash":"prykhtgd","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Banks","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Banks","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-3","ftm_eid":2949733,"votesmart_id":116801,"opensecrets_id":"N00037185","knowwho_pid":291462,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Banks_(Indiana)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9033,"person_hash":"6pij8w6c","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Susan Davis","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-53","ftm_eid":2550215,"votesmart_id":8168,"opensecrets_id":"N00009604","knowwho_pid":193104,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Davis_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9285,"person_hash":"tko30c9f","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ann Kirkpatrick","first_name":"Ann","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kirkpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-1","ftm_eid":6459062,"votesmart_id":28425,"opensecrets_id":"N00029260","knowwho_pid":227470,"ballotpedia":"Ann_Kirkpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9193,"person_hash":"4p9iymg5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cathy McMorris Rodgers","first_name":"Cathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McMorris Rodgers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-5","ftm_eid":2941046,"votesmart_id":3217,"opensecrets_id":"N00026314","knowwho_pid":199779,"ballotpedia":"Cathy_McMorris_Rodgers","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1467","sast_bill_id":1261166},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1790","sast_bill_id":1267965},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2500","sast_bill_id":1256454},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR758","sast_bill_id":1288053}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13449,"subject_name":"Military operations and strategy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2029363,"date":"2019-05-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2727\/id\/2029363","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2727\/BILLS-116hr2727ih.pdf","text_size":212049,"text_hash":"2a4e099ebcd8b69387620da6a36ca4f3"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
