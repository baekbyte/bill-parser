It also specifies that no provision of the Controlled Substances Act prohibits or restricts activities related to medical marijuana that comply with a state's medical marijuana law. The bill does not affect any federal, state, or local law that regulates or prohibits smoking in public. Under current law, schedule I controlled substances are those that, among other factors, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; such substances thus may not be prescribed, administered, or dispensed for medical use. Substances listed in schedules II through V have some accepted medical use and thus may be prescribed, administered, or dispensed for medical use.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
