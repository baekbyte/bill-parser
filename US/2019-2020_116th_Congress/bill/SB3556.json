The Department of Education (ED) may extend deferment eligibility to students who graduate in 2021 and 2022, if ED determines that the anticipated economic impact of the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19 or another coronavirus with pandemic potential) on these graduates necessitates an extension. ED must consider certain factors, such as recent unemployment statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when determining whether to extend deferment eligibility to these graduates.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-20","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-20","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20296,"person_hash":"2w752buq","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mitt Romney","first_name":"Willard","middle_name":"Mitt","last_name":"Romney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":43351,"votesmart_id":21942,"opensecrets_id":"N00000286","knowwho_pid":213247,"ballotpedia":"Mitt_Romney","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6502","sast_bill_id":1363127}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2178511,"date":"2020-04-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3556\/id\/2178511","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3556\/BILLS-116s3556is.pdf","text_size":315390,"text_hash":"42649b1ff488deaa8a48e70217128a55"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
