Specifically, the bill establishes the minimum requirements for the net price calculator that an IHE must include on its website. An IHE's net price is the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at the school after deducting such aid. It authorizes the Department of Education to develop a universal net price calculator that enables users to answer one set of questions and receive net prices for several IHEs and compare those prices.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-27","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9484,"person_hash":"1zy2f3m5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Chuck Grassley","first_name":"Chuck","middle_name":"","last_name":"Grassley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6338995,"votesmart_id":53293,"opensecrets_id":"N00001758","knowwho_pid":165215,"ballotpedia":"Chuck_Grassley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16519,"person_hash":"39r6j2zz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joni Ernst","first_name":"Joni","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ernst","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6151700,"votesmart_id":128583,"opensecrets_id":"N00035483","knowwho_pid":328986,"ballotpedia":"Joni_Ernst","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9444,"person_hash":"0ie58qto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cornyn","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cornyn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":6646197,"votesmart_id":15375,"opensecrets_id":"N00024852","knowwho_pid":211675,"ballotpedia":"John_Cornyn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1915","sast_bill_id":1245856}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1990069,"date":"2019-04-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB889\/id\/1990069","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s889\/BILLS-116s889is.pdf","text_size":286410,"text_hash":"ecc6395349f94e370a946522012ad85f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
