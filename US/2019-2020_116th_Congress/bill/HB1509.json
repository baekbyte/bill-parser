Under the bill, remotely created checks may only be issued by a person specifically designated in writing by a consumer and provided to the consumer's depository institution. (A remotely created check is a check not issued by the bank and not signed by the account owner.) A voluntary agreement to repay a small-dollar consumer credit transaction by an electronic fund transfer is subject to certain protections, including the right of the consumer to stop payment. Small-dollar consumer credit providers must register with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any small-dollar consumer credit transaction is subject to the laws of the state in which the consumer resides. The bill also prohibits overdraft fees on prepaid accounts.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":13869,"person_hash":"zwfqam9j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzanne Bonamici","first_name":"Suzanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bonamici","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-1","ftm_eid":339835,"votesmart_id":59641,"opensecrets_id":"N00033474","knowwho_pid":249764,"ballotpedia":"Suzanne_Bonamici","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9030,"person_hash":"2bv7ebq4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elijah Cummings","first_name":"Elijah","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Cummings","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-7","ftm_eid":5430817,"votesmart_id":345,"opensecrets_id":"N00001971","knowwho_pid":158891,"ballotpedia":"Elijah_Cummings","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB656","sast_bill_id":1231003}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20665,"subject_name":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1967880,"date":"2019-03-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1509\/id\/1967880","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1509\/BILLS-116hr1509ih.pdf","text_size":173462,"text_hash":"ffe0c37ff8e3745a49296c59233ac7ac"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
