Such income includes (1) distributions from qualified disability trusts, (2) certain military survivor benefits, (3) certain first responder survivor benefits, (4) certain Indian tribal payments, (5) certain scholarships or fellowship grants, (6) Alaska permanent fund dividends, and (7) Social Security benefits. Treating such income as earned income allows it to be taxed at lower rates.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
