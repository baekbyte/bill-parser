The House Clerk, Chief Administrative Officer, and Sergeant at Arms shall work together to develop and implement a secure remote voting system that gives members who are absent from the floor permission to cast a vote remotely on a motion to suspend the rules if the vote is taken by electronic device. A member who casts such a vote using the remote voting system shall be treated as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for considering the motion. Each House committee must permit its absent committee members or other participants in the committee's hearing to use video conferencing and related technologies in order to participate in the hearing to the same extent as members of the committee and other participants who are present at the site of the meeting. A committee must adopt a rule under which a member who participates in a hearing remotely shall be included in determining the number of members constituting a quorum at the hearing.","pending_committee_id":2312,"committee":{"committee_id":2312,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-09","committee_id":2312,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Rules.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15238,"person_hash":"ljvyxtoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eric Swalwell","first_name":"Eric","middle_name":"","last_name":"Swalwell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-15","ftm_eid":15742560,"votesmart_id":129529,"opensecrets_id":"N00033508","knowwho_pid":378800,"ballotpedia":"Eric_Swalwell","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11047,"person_hash":"73ahm40c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eric Crawford","first_name":"Eric","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Crawford","suffix":"","nickname":"Rick","district":"HD-AR-1","ftm_eid":17657353,"votesmart_id":119208,"opensecrets_id":"N00030770","knowwho_pid":283914,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Crawford_(Arkansas)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16477,"person_hash":"zuh8egxj","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elise Stefanik","first_name":"Elise","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stefanik","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-21","ftm_eid":21236694,"votesmart_id":152539,"opensecrets_id":"N00035523","knowwho_pid":247560,"ballotpedia":"Elise_Stefanik","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13525,"subject_name":"Congress"},{"subject_id":13677,"subject_name":"Congressional committees"},{"subject_id":13466,"subject_name":"Congressional operations and organization"},{"subject_id":13590,"subject_name":"House of Representatives"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2166370,"date":"2020-03-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HR890\/id\/2166370","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hres890\/BILLS-116hres890ih.pdf","text_size":318122,"text_hash":"7b91df94bb73ab01b1abb12dde4ca28e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
