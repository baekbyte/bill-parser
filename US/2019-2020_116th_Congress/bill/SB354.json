The requirement applies to a group in which all of the plans are individual account plans or defined contribution plans; have the same trustee, the same one or more named fiduciaries, the same administrator, and plan years beginning on the same date; and provide the same investments or investment options to participants and beneficiaries. The bill also specifies that, for the purposes of applying the numerical limitations related to the electronic filing of returns for deferred compensation plans, each plan for which information is provided on the return must be treated as a separate return.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-06","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-06","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9459,"person_hash":"f0qn5jvf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Collins","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":10045641,"votesmart_id":379,"opensecrets_id":"N00000491","knowwho_pid":165234,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Collins_(Maine)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB982","sast_bill_id":1191435},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1007","sast_bill_id":1194223},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1994","sast_bill_id":1247246},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR389","sast_bill_id":1263085},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1865","sast_bill_id":1244471}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13587,"subject_name":"Income tax deferral"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1925030,"date":"2019-02-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB354\/id\/1925030","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s354\/BILLS-116s354is.pdf","text_size":157269,"text_hash":"14b0559b882c763155340ed788d7ea0d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
