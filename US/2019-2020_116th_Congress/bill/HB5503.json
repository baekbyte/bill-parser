(A high-commuter corridor is a federal lands transportation facility administered by the NPS that has average annual daily traffic of not less than 20,000 vehicles.) If the NPS determines that a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment it must submit to the state information on the condition of pavements and bridges; an estimate of the amounts needed to bring such corridor into a state of good repair, taking into consideration any planned future investments; and at its discretion, a request that the state transfer to the NPS a portion of the amounts necessary to address the condition of the corridor. The bill sets forth the criteria the NPS must consider when making a determination of whether a a high-commuter corridor requires additional investment.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-19","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-12-20","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-20","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18293,"person_hash":"vidnqcls","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brown","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-4","ftm_eid":5017996,"votesmart_id":19344,"opensecrets_id":"N00036999","knowwho_pid":195317,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9118,"person_hash":"6pt9at2x","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"C.A.
