The Department of State shall report to Congress an assessment of Russia and Venezuela's security cooperation and the threat it poses to countries in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States. The State Department shall also devise a strategy to counter such a threat. The President shall report to Congress an assessment of the national security risks posed by a potential Russian acquisition of CITGO's U.S. energy infrastructure holdings. CITGO is an energy company owned by Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA), a Venezuelan state-owned oil company. A Russian state-owned company has extended a loan to PdVSA, and a default on that loan could result in Russian ownership of CITGO. The bill bars the entry into the United States of aliens who have worked on behalf of Russia to support Venezuelan security forces. It also revokes any current visas belonging to such individuals. The President may waive this bar as to an alien if it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},{"date":"2019-03-26","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-14","action":"Committee Agreed to Seek Consideration Under Suspension of the Rules.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-25","action":"Mr. Malinowski moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-25","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
