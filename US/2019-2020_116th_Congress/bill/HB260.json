Specifically, the bill makes appropriations for FY2019 for, and otherwise revises, the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program; temporarily extends the applicability of Medicaid eligibility criteria that protect against spousal impoverishment for recipients of home and community-based services; reduces the federal medical assistance percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) for states that have not implemented asset-verification programs for determining Medicaid eligibility; reduces funding available to the Medicaid Improvement Fund beginning in FY2021; reauthorizes through FY2020 several grant programs under TANF, such as family assistance grants; and revises state reporting requirements under TANF to include specified employment data, such as employment outcomes for former TANF recipients.","pending_committee_id":3987,"committee":{"committee_id":3987,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Worker and Family
