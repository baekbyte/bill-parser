Additionally, DOT shall not calculate a benefit-to-cost ratio with respect to an air traffic control tower participating in the Contract Tower Program on the basis of an annual aircraft traffic decrease in FY2020 and FY2021. Under the Contract Tower Program, air traffic control towers are staffed by employees of private companies rather than by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees. The FAA is required to perform a benefit-cost analysis to determine eligibility for participation in the program.","pending_committee_id":2549,"committee":{"committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-27","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-07-28","committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-28","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Aviation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9168,"person_hash":"c40vdlmx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Young","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AK","ftm_eid":17658637,"votesmart_id":26717,"opensecrets_id":"N00007999","knowwho_pid":158699,"ballotpedia":"Don_Young_(Alaska)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9131,"person_hash":"ny4mzjov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Albio Sires","first_name":"Albio","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sires","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-8","ftm_eid":6389364,"votesmart_id":22510,"opensecrets_id":"N00027523","knowwho_pid":197402,"ballotpedia":"Albio_Sires","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9324,"person_hash":"88p7q4un","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adrian Smith","first_name":"Adrian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NE-3","ftm_eid":6558263,"votesmart_id":21284,"opensecrets_id":"N00027623","knowwho_pid":196871,"ballotpedia":"Adrian_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8976,"person_hash":"rffp6oz3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Henry Johnson","first_name":"Henry","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Johnson","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Hank","district":"HD-GA-4","ftm_eid":17658662,"votesmart_id":68070,"opensecrets_id":"N00027848","knowwho_pid":248293,"ballotpedia":"Hank_Johnson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
