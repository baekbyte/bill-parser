The resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism.

Law enforcement is encouraged to avoid conduct that raises the specter of unconstitutional profiling against anyone because of their race, religion, nationality, politics, or social group. This resolution also acknowledges the harm suffered by Muslims from harassment, discrimination, and violence and condemns anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against all minorities. Finally, the resolution condemns death threats received by Jewish and Muslim Members of Congress.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-07","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Mr. Nadler moved to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
