Specifically, it removes silencers from the list of firearms subject to regulation (i.e., registration and licensing requirements) under the National Firearms Act (NFA). Additionally, it excludes a muffler or silencer from the list of firearms subject to regulation (e.g., background check requirements) under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). Finally, the bill does the following: preempts state or local laws that tax or regulate firearm silencers, specifies that a person who lawfully acquires or possesses a silencer under provisions of the GCA meets the registration and licensing requirements of the NFA, eliminates mandatory minimum prison terms for a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense in which a defendant uses or carries a firearm equipped with a silencer or muffler, and permits active and retired law enforcement officers to carry a concealed silencer.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-24","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9445,"person_hash":"f2k79x2t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Crapo","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crapo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":19890076,"votesmart_id":26830,"opensecrets_id":"N00006267","knowwho_pid":165218,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Crapo","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9496,"person_hash":"gcopvn6m","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Risch","first_name":"James","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Risch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":6576171,"votesmart_id":2919,"opensecrets_id":"N00029441","knowwho_pid":213702,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Risch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9444,"person_hash":"0ie58qto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cornyn","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cornyn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":6646197,"votesmart_id":15375,"opensecrets_id":"N00024852","knowwho_pid":211675,"ballotpedia":"John_Cornyn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15313,"person_hash":"kkwugc78","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ted Cruz","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cruz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":210204,"votesmart_id":135705,"opensecrets_id":"N00033085","knowwho_pid":378522,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Cruz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11893,"person_hash":"kj744t8v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rand Paul","first_name":"Rand","middle_name":"","last_name":"Paul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KY","ftm_eid":9337758,"votesmart_id":117285,"opensecrets_id":"N00030836","knowwho_pid":285781,"ballotpedia":"Rand_Paul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB775","sast_bill_id":1173176},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB155","sast_bill_id":1137325},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB817","sast_bill_id":1239600}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13340,"subject_name":"Crime and law enforcement"},{"subject_id":13185,"subject_name":"Federal preemption"},{"subject_id":13341,"subject_name":"Firearms and explosives"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1894126,"date":"2019-02-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB202\/id\/1894126","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s202\/BILLS-116s202is.pdf","text_size":160510,"text_hash":"21b83213fc4dfef53b3e3a7bd5679d4c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
