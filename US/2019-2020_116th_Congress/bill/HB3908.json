(Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations Acts.) If the actual total cost of the direct spending legislation exceeds the estimated total cost, the report must also include proposed legislative language to eliminate the excess cost. Within seven days of receiving a report from the OMB, the President must submit to Congress any proposed legislative language included in the report. Congress must then consider the proposed legislation using specified expedited legislative procedures. The budgetary effects of legislation considered pursuant to this bill may not be entered on the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) scorecards maintained under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.","pending_committee_id":2300,"committee":{"committee_id":2300,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Budget"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-23","committee_id":2300,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Budget"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Budget, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11060,"person_hash":"g4hq688c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adam Kinzinger","first_name":"Adam","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kinzinger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-16","ftm_eid":17657449,"votesmart_id":116559,"opensecrets_id":"N00030667","knowwho_pid":284452,"ballotpedia":"Adam_Kinzinger","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9027,"person_hash":"5fj074kg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jim Cooper","first_name":"Jim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cooper","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-5","ftm_eid":17658367,"votesmart_id":48891,"opensecrets_id":"N00003132","knowwho_pid":211701,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Cooper_(Tennessee)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14925,"person_hash":"r2dpo5e5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Yoho","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yoho","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-3","ftm_eid":17657842,"votesmart_id":137622,"opensecrets_id":"N00033220","knowwho_pid":378855,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Yoho","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048018,"date":"2019-08-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3908\/id\/2048018","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3908\/BILLS-116hr3908ih.pdf","text_size":381083,"text_hash":"ee34ba0ccb34f94a56565f1f4927bc7a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
