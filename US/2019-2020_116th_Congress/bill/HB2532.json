The Department of the Interior may issue a permit for taking (e.g., killing, harming, or capturing), possessing, or transporting grizzly bears, or their parts if such taking, possession, or transportation is for purposes of science, exhibition, tribal religion, agricultural protection, or public safety. Such permits must be compatible with the protection of the grizzly bear species or a population of grizzly bears occupying a geographically distinct area. In addition, Interior must establish (1) a Grizzly Bear Scientific Committee, and (2) a grant program for assisting livestock producers with issues of livestock predation. Finally, the bill provides for the reintroduction of grizzly bears on tribal land.","pending_committee_id":3354,"committee":{"committee_id":3354,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
