Under current law, the RFS specifies the minimum volume of renewable fuel, such as ethanol, that must be contained in gasoline sold in the United States, except in noncontiguous states or territories. The RFS annually increases until 2022 when a minimum of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel must be blended into gasoline. decreases the volume of renewable fuel that must be contained in gasoline to 7.5 billion gallons each year. The bill also revises the RFS to eliminate separate volume requirements for the following renewable fuel categories: advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel. Petitions for waivers from requirements under the renewable fuel program may not be brought by a person who is subject to the requirements of the program, nor by the EPA on its own motion. The EPA may not authorize the sale of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, unless the gasoline was registered under the program and lawfully sold in the United States before this bill's enactment. The EPA must study the effects of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, including the effects on consumer products, such as nonroad vehicles.","pending_committee_id":4135,"committee":{"committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9176,"person_hash":"cu7fgqvh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Burgess","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Burgess","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-26","ftm_eid":17658442,"votesmart_id":50120,"opensecrets_id":"N00025219","knowwho_pid":211708,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Burgess","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13247,"subject_name":"Motor fuels"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1846902,"date":"2019-01-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB104\/id\/1846902","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr104\/BILLS-116hr104ih.pdf","text_size":259310,"text_hash":"822ea7990788cc9253ab130239d72c44"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
