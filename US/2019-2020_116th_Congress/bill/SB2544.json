areas a tax credit to assist in retaining employees affected by disasters, suspends the limitation on the tax deduction for charitable contributions for disaster relief, allows nonitemizing taxpayers to claim personal casualty losses, and allows the use of earned income for the preceding year for claiming the earning income and child tax credits.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-25","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Read
