The bill removes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the acting agency that provides for the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on military installations, except in the case of a military installation or state-owned National Guard installation in Alaska. Each integrated natural resources management plan for a military installation or state-owned National Guard installation outside Alaska must be reviewed (1) jointly by the military department concerned and the Department of the Interior, and (2) in a manner that provides affected states and Indian tribes and the public an opportunity to comment on any significant revisions to the plan that may be proposed. The bill eliminates the withdrawal termination date for lands including (1) the El Centro Naval Air Facility in California, (2) the Juniper Butte military range in Idaho, (3) the Barry M. Goldwater military range in Arizona, and (4) the Fort Irwin military land withdrawal in California. The land withdrawals for the Fort Greely and Fort Wainwright military training ranges in Alaska shall be terminated on November 6, 2026.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-23","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-05-24","committee_id":2360,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Readiness"},{"date":"2019-06-11","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-24","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Readiness.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9243,"person_hash":"qfajed2l","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rob Bishop","first_name":"Rob","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bishop","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-1","ftm_eid":15107372,"votesmart_id":50544,"opensecrets_id":"N00025292","knowwho_pid":211710,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Bishop","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13396,"subject_name":"Alaska"},{"subject_id":13391,"subject_name":"California"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":321582,"subject_name":"Geography and mapping"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13549,"subject_name":"Idaho"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13244,"subject_name":"Military facilities and property"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2035070,"date":"2019-06-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2945\/id\/2035070","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2945\/BILLS-116hr2945ih.pdf","text_size":420278,"text_hash":"237d33004d7ece96cb91edc60cdf9dc6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
