The bill also authorizes the Department of the Treasury to classify as crude oil or as a petroleum product subject to such tax any fuel feedstock or finished fuel product transported by pipeline, vessel, railcar, or tanker truck if such classification is consistent with the definition of oil under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and such fuel feedstock or finished fuel product is produced in sufficient commercial quantities as to pose a significant risk of hazard in the event of a discharge.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-14","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-14","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9010,"person_hash":"wwcneni0","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Blumenauer","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-3","ftm_eid":4977792,"votesmart_id":367,"opensecrets_id":"N00007727","knowwho_pid":159028,"ballotpedia":"Earl_Blumenauer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15204,"person_hash":"ksrih99k","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Kildee","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"Kildee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-5","ftm_eid":520771,"votesmart_id":136102,"opensecrets_id":"N00033395","knowwho_pid":294255,"ballotpedia":"Dan_Kildee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3315","sast_bill_id":1338877},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7781","sast_bill_id":1374413},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8411","sast_bill_id":1379370}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13247,"subject_name":"Motor fuels"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13392,"subject_name":"Pipelines"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2145098,"date":"2020-02-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5914\/id\/2145098","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5914\/BILLS-116hr5914ih.pdf","text_size":319284,"text_hash":"ffb4515ddd30738ff7c8e176b396ceed"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
