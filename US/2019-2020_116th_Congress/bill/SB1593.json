DOE must establish a program for the research of energy storage systems, components, and materials. DOE must also establish a technical assistance and grant program for (1) disseminating information and providing technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems; and (2) making grants to those entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems. The bill provides for the establishment of a competitive grant program for pilot energy storage systems.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-09","action":"Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy.
