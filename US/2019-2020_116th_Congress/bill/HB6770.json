(Transportation demand management is the use of strategies to inform and encourage travelers to maximize the efficiency of a transportation system leading to improved mobility, reduced congestion, and lower vehicle emissions.) Each state and metropolitan planning organization must include TDM targets in the development of their long-range transportation plans. The bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program to encourage and assist the development and funding of TDM related projects. Additionally, DOT must provide grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education to establish and operate a university transportation center for research and development related to TDM and TDM strategies. (TDM strategies means the use of planning, programs, policy, marketing, communications, incentives, pricing, and technology to shift travel mode, routes used, departure times, number of trips, and location and design work space or public attractions.) The bill establishes a National Advisory Committee under the Federal Highways Administration to strategically direct federal resources and policies toward implementation of TDM objectives. Additionally, each state must establish advisory committees focused on the development and furthering of the principles of TDM.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-05-11","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9035,"person_hash":"g25cpbse","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rosa DeLauro","first_name":"Rosa","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"DeLauro","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-3","ftm_eid":5349073,"votesmart_id":26788,"opensecrets_id":"N00000615","knowwho_pid":158778,"ballotpedia":"Rosa_DeLauro","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9083,"person_hash":"71w6elpz","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Zoe Lofgren","first_name":"Zoe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lofgren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-19","ftm_eid":761620,"votesmart_id":21899,"opensecrets_id":"N00007479","knowwho_pid":158733,"ballotpedia":"Zoe_Lofgren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8997,"person_hash":"jzjhfzqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter Welch","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"","last_name":"Welch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VT","ftm_eid":9959484,"votesmart_id":51272,"opensecrets_id":"N00000515","knowwho_pid":210068,"ballotpedia":"Peter_Welch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13773,"subject_name":"Motor carriers"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2188309,"date":"2020-05-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6770\/id\/2188309","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6770\/BILLS-116hr6770ih.pdf","text_size":335537,"text_hash":"d7fe016eeec2a29b447c6ea487c3d8f0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
