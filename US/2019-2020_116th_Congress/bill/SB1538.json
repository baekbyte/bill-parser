The bill removes the maximum limit on the fair market value of the properties to be identified by the board. The list of the properties identified for disposal shall be submitted to the President and Congress (currently, the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] and Congress) as board recommendations and subject to the approval process under the Act. The General Services Administration shall continue to initiate the sale of federal civilian real properties, but in accordance with environmental considerations. The bill transfers the responsibilities of the OMB to the President and requires submission to the President of the two separate reports on the board's findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The bill increases the maximum limit on the total value of transactions that may be contained in such reports. The bill establishes a process for the review of the board's recommendations by the President and Congress. The bill exempts properties included in the recommendations for disposal or realignment from certain public benefit conveyance requirements, including the McKinney-Vento Act (requiring surplus property to be used to assist the homeless). The bill limits the authority of certain executive agencies to lease space for the purposes of a public building.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-16","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9244,"person_hash":"49k7k8ng","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Roy Blunt","first_name":"Roy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blunt","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-7","ftm_eid":3837002,"votesmart_id":418,"opensecrets_id":"N00005195","knowwho_pid":158925,"ballotpedia":"Roy_Blunt","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9488,"person_hash":"vxlaliuo","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lindsey Graham","first_name":"Lindsey","middle_name":"","last_name":"Graham","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-SC","ftm_eid":8463292,"votesmart_id":21992,"opensecrets_id":"N00009975","knowwho_pid":159057,"ballotpedia":"Lindsey_Graham","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20294,"person_hash":"1lllgwva","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Braun","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Braun","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":21084493,"votesmart_id":148564,"opensecrets_id":"N00041731","knowwho_pid":484213,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Braun","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13196,"subject_name":"Government buildings, facilities, and property"},{"subject_id":13217,"subject_name":"Homelessness and emergency shelter"},{"subject_id":13380,"subject_name":"Land transfers"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2033100,"date":"2019-06-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1538\/id\/2033100","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1538\/BILLS-116s1538is.pdf","text_size":177391,"text_hash":"74fd9ce584a77b99a5946b69d1c529fb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
