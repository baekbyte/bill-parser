traditional IRA, increases the credit limitation for small employer pension plan startup costs, allows a new tax credit for small employer automatic enrollment plans, exempts certain individuals with pension plan assets not exceeding $50,000 from required minimum distribution rules, and modifies nondiscrimination rules to protect certain older pension plan participants, Additionally, the bill (1) expands 529 plans to allow distributions for registered apprenticeship programs, education loan repayments, and certain elementary and secondary school expenses in addition to tuition; (2) allows unborn children to be beneficiaries of 529 plans; and (3) permits penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans for expenses related to the birth or adoption of a child.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
