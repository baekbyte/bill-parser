Specifically, the bill makes permanent a provision that allows a multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) to retransmit television-station signals directly to a home if the subscriber receiving the signal resides in an unserved household located outside the local market of such a station. The bill also allows an MVPD to designate a qualified MVPD buying group to negotiate on its behalf with large broadcast ownership groups regarding retransmission consent for broadcast programming. Further, the bill requires that providers of internet, voice, mobile, data, and MVPD services (1) engage in transparent sales and e-billing, and (2) refrain from charging a consumer for using equipment not provided by the service provider.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-12","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-11-13","committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and Technology"},{"date":"2019-12-11","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-04","action":"Hearings Held by the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Prior to Introduction and Referral.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-14","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-14","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-09","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
