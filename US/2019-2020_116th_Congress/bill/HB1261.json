The USGS shall, among other things develop and publish a national strategy for landslide hazards, risk reduction, and response in the United States (including territories); develop and maintain a publicly accessible national landslide hazard and risk inventory database; expand the early warning system for debris flow; and establish emergency response procedures for the rapid deployment of federal scientists, equipment, and services to areas impacted by a significant landslide event. The USGS may provide grants to research, map, assess, and collect data on landslide hazards. The National Science Foundation may provide grants to eligible entities for landslide research. The USGS (1) shall advance the identification, mapping, research, monitoring, restoration, and mitigation of subsidence and groundwater resource accounting, losses from subsidence, including saltwater intrusion, particularly in areas affected by drought and sea level rise; (2) shall establish the 3D Elevation Program and the 3D Elevation Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee; and (3) may make grants and enter into cooperative agreements to facilitate the improvement of nationwide coverage of 3D elevation data.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-03-07","committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-07","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Unanimous Consent.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources.
