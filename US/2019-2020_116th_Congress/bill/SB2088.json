The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must, upon request, provide a community with appropriate data to assist in preparation of the required plan. In making decisions with respect to awarding flood risk mitigation grants, FEMA may consider the extent to which a community has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas. A community that does not comply with these requirements may be subject to appropriate sanctions, including suspension from the National Flood Insurance Program.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-11","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5776","sast_bill_id":1333420}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13157,"subject_name":"Department of Homeland Security"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":13810,"subject_name":"Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)"},{"subject_id":13189,"subject_name":"Floods and storm protection"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2046622,"date":"2019-07-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2088\/id\/2046622","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2088\/BILLS-116s2088is.pdf","text_size":251025,"text_hash":"a32710f36e46081ce52a622f01f1d0cb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
