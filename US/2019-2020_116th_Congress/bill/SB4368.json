It also makes changes to reporting requirements, threat-based reviews, and other aspects of the administration of the stockpile. Specifically, it authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to use authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 during a declared public health emergency to the same extent as the President is authorized to do so. Currently, that act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense. In addition, the Government Accountability Office must assess any plans related to the domestic supply chain in its annual reports on the stockpile.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-29","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13485,"subject_name":"Military procurement, research, weapons development"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13945,"subject_name":"Strategic materials and reserves"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205477,"date":"2020-08-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4368\/id\/2205477","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4368\/BILLS-116s4368is.pdf","text_size":327024,"text_hash":"ea867fd15c57eeb6357d818dd2afecfe"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
