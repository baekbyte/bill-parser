Specifically, the bill (1) establishes new performance indicators related to employment and educational outcomes for states receiving TANF funds; (2) increases the percentage of TANF funds, from 30% to 50%, that may be used to support other state programs; and (3) allows states to use TANF funds to carry out certain workforce development programs. Under current law, states may use TANF funds to support other state programs only if they are related to Child Care and Development Block Grants or Social Services Block Grants. States must negotiate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a level of performance for each indicator, taking into account certain economic, demographic, and other factors. HHS must periodically revise levels of performance for states to reflect economic and other conditions.","pending_committee_id":3987,"committee":{"committee_id":3987,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-27","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-27","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-27","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Labor, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-27","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14923,"person_hash":"01ht21s1","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brad Wenstrup","first_name":"Brad","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Wenstrup","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-2","ftm_eid":2596103,"votesmart_id":135326,"opensecrets_id":"N00033310","knowwho_pid":378835,"ballotpedia":"Brad_Wenstrup","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14921,"person_hash":"64rh9cfq","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jackie Walorski","first_name":"Jackie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Walorski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IN-2","ftm_eid":6659187,"votesmart_id":34205,"opensecrets_id":"N00031226","knowwho_pid":227370,"ballotpedia":"Jackie_Walorski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18303,"person_hash":"yj5aoa7r","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Drew Ferguson","first_name":"Drew","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ferguson","suffix":"IV","nickname":"","district":"HD-GA-3","ftm_eid":7259444,"votesmart_id":168132,"opensecrets_id":"N00039090","knowwho_pid":603326,"ballotpedia":"Drew_Ferguson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9324,"person_hash":"88p7q4un","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adrian Smith","first_name":"Adrian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NE-3","ftm_eid":6558263,"votesmart_id":21284,"opensecrets_id":"N00027623","knowwho_pid":196871,"ballotpedia":"Adrian_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1490","sast_bill_id":1229707},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB802","sast_bill_id":1239626},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1753","sast_bill_id":1239651},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3001","sast_bill_id":1287832}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13383,"subject_name":"Social welfare"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1960492,"date":"2019-03-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1413\/id\/1960492","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1413\/BILLS-116hr1413ih.pdf","text_size":167693,"text_hash":"cbcdefa53d751f7d3a0d12a3d254f8bd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
