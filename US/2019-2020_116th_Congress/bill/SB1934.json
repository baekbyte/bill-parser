The proximate cause of the disability or death in these situations must have been (1) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or a similar instance of fault on the part of the provider; or (2) an event that was not reasonably foreseeable.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-20","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-20","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9471,"person_hash":"61xtznm6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jon Tester","first_name":"Jon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7974707,"votesmart_id":20928,"opensecrets_id":"N00027605","knowwho_pid":196276,"ballotpedia":"Jon_Tester","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9431,"person_hash":"y4pijgni","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Patty Murray","first_name":"Patty","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murray","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":18930579,"votesmart_id":53358,"opensecrets_id":"N00007876","knowwho_pid":165286,"ballotpedia":"Patty_Murray","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13218,"subject_name":"Hospital care"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2044344,"date":"2019-06-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1934\/id\/2044344","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1934\/BILLS-116s1934is.pdf","text_size":363444,"text_hash":"2dd8129b486865ff56492146ae6ab0e8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
