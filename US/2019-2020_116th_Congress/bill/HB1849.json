Specifically, the bill permits a state or other obligator to make a determination whether loans under these programs are treated as a federal or non-federal share of a project; and requires the Department of Transportation to treat the proceeds of a loan that a state has elected to treat as a non-federal share of project costs as a local financial commitment, and not treat such proceeds as non-local sources of capital and operating financing.","pending_committee_id":2527,"committee":{"committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
