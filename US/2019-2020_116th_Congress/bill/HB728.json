Specifically, the bill reauthorizes (1) loan repayment and scholarships for nurses; (2) loans for nursing faculty development; (3) advanced education nursing grants; (4) grants for increasing nursing workforce diversity; and (5) nurse education, practice, quality, and retention grants.Eligibility for nurse education, practice, quality, and retention grants is expanded to include nurse-managed health clinics that provide primary care to underserved communities. Further, grants for nursing career ladder programs are expanded to (1) promote career advancement for individuals to become registered nurses or advanced education nurses and (2) support internships and residency programs that encourage mentoring and the development of specialties.In addition, eligibility for advanced education nursing grants is expanded to include education of clinical nurse leaders in combined registered nurse graduate degree programs. Clinical nurse leaders are advanced generalist clinicians who apply research and coordinate care to improve outcomes for patients. Eligibility is also extended to clinical nurse specialist programs that provide registered nurses with full-time clinical nurse specialist education that qualifies participating nurses to provide a full range of care.The bill also revises specified grant reporting and program evaluation requirements.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-23","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2019-10-29","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee (Amended) by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-24","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
