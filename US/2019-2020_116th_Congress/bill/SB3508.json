The bill prohibits furnishers of credit information from reporting adverse credit information that is the result of any inaction or action that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also prohibits any such reporting regarding a consumer who resides in an area covered by a major disaster declaration. Credit reporting agencies are prohibited from including in a credit report any such adverse credit information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must create a website that allows consumers to report economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster. Consumers may request the deletion of adverse credit information and request an extension of certain credit protections. Credit reporting agencies must provide unlimited free credit reports and free credit scores upon request (1) during the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster, and (2) for a year afterwards.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-17","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19529,"person_hash":"ygy5eihl","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Doug Jones","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Jones","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AL","ftm_eid":15183709,"votesmart_id":176464,"opensecrets_id":"N00024817","knowwho_pid":625255,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Jones_(Alabama)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6379","sast_bill_id":1361588},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6370","sast_bill_id":1361608},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6321","sast_bill_id":1361595},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6800","sast_bill_id":1365578},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR967","sast_bill_id":1366004}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2177423,"date":"2020-04-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3508\/id\/2177423","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3508\/BILLS-116s3508is.pdf","text_size":325942,"text_hash":"60a3ff33bf761446266a46a1a2ba65ba"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
