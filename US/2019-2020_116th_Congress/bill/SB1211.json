Specifically, the bill modifies the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) approval process for tribal transportation safety projects to categorically exclude qualifying projects from requirements to conduct environmental assessments and environmental impact statements. A tribal transportation safety project is one that is eligible for assistance under the tribal transportation program and that (1) corrects or improves a hazardous road location or feature, or (2) addresses a highway safety problem. The Department of the Interior must (1) review existing Federal Highway Administration categorical exclusions to determine applicability to tribal transportation program projects, and (2) identify types of tribal transportation safety projects that meet general categorical exclusion requirements. Interior must establish categorical exclusions for tribal projects consistent with its findings. The bill prescribes requirements for the expedited review and approval of tribal transportation safety projects under NEPA or other federal laws. Interior must enter into five-year programmatic agreements with tribes that establish efficient administrative procedures for carrying out environmental reviews for tribal transportation program projects. The bill authorizes through FY2025 the program to fund tribal transportation facility bridge projects and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) road maintenance program. Per the bill, Customs and Border Protection may transfer funds to the BIA to maintain or repair roads in certain situations. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to develop best practices and a standardized form in relation to motor vehicle crash data on certain tribal lands.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-11","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-11","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Committee on Indian Affairs.
