The bill establishes mandatory set-asides for (1) minority CDFIs under the CDFI Fund, and (2) CDFIs and MDIs under existing COVID-19 economic aid programs. The bill also establishes an impact bank designation for certain small depository institutions that lend primarily to low-income borrowers and establishes programs for impact banks and MDIs regarding investments, technical assistance, and federal government deposits. Finally, the Department of the Treasury must provide capital and interest-free loans to CDFIs, MDIs, impact banks, and credit unions that primarily serve low-income, underserved communities. The bill also reduces the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program minimum issuance amount from $100 million to $25 million for FY2020 and to $50 million for fiscal years thereafter.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial
