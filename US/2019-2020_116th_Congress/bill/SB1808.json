In establishing the process, the State Department must identify which information technology should be included, determine whether the process should differentiate among and specify the types of security vulnerabilities that may be targeted, and provide a readily available form and means of reporting, amongst other requirements. The bill requires the State Department to establish a bug bounty pilot program, where an approved individual, organization, or company is temporarily authorized to identify and report vulnerabilities of internet-facing information technology of the State Department in exchange for compensation.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-12","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11052,"person_hash":"aa3xvp5z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Gardner","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gardner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5988870,"votesmart_id":30004,"opensecrets_id":"N00030780","knowwho_pid":210102,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Gardner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB328","sast_bill_id":1141981}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2040642,"date":"2019-06-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1808\/id\/2040642","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1808\/BILLS-116s1808is.pdf","text_size":134465,"text_hash":"3db535530a0e9531a9090d94636c57eb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
