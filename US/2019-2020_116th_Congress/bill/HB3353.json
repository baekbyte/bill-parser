Specifically, it reduces the interest rate and eliminates the origination fee for a parent PLUS loan disbursed on or after July 1, 2019. The Department of Education must ensure, prior to disbursement, that parent PLUS loan borrowers receive counseling that includes comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loans and the responsibilities of the borrowers. The bill makes parent PLUS loans eligible for the income-contingent and income-based repayment plans. Additionally, it makes consolidation loans that repay parent PLUS loans eligible for the income-based repayment plans.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-19","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9045,"person_hash":"mcq0g6jm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Marcia Fudge","first_name":"Marcia","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Fudge","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-11","ftm_eid":14904741,"votesmart_id":110640,"opensecrets_id":"N00030490","knowwho_pid":271756,"ballotpedia":"Marcia_Fudge","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9023,"person_hash":"6f2n6oig","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Emanuel Cleaver","first_name":"Emanuel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cleaver","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-5","ftm_eid":4396432,"votesmart_id":39507,"opensecrets_id":"N00026790","knowwho_pid":226522,"ballotpedia":"Emanuel_Cleaver","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
