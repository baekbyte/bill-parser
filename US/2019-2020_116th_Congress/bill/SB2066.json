Specifically, the bill requires the State Department to review and report on (1) the U.S.-Saudi Arabia bilateral relationship, (2) Saudi government activities within the United States, and (3) measures to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the war in Yemen and the protection of Yemeni civilians and cultural property. In addition, the bill directs the President to deny a visa for a citizen of Saudi Arabia who (1) is related to King Abd al Aziz bin Abd al Rahman Al Saud, and (2) is a high-ranking official in the Saudi government. The President must also deny a visa for the spouse or child of such an individual. The President must also impose sanctions on persons determined to be hindering humanitarian access in Yemen or threatening the peace or stability of Yemen. Additionally, unless the President determines that the Houthis (Iranian-sponsored rebels) have engaged meaningfully in certain efforts towards stability in Yemen, the President must impose sanctions on persons determined to be supporting the Houthis in Yemen. The President is authorized to enter a cooperative project agreement with countries in the Arabian Peninsula to produce defense articles and services for detecting and destroying armed drones that threaten the United States and its partners. Further, the Department of the Treasury is authorized to provide technical assistance to improve governance at the Central Bank of Yemen.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign
