Additionally, the bill revises and expands requirements for asthma surveillance activities and requires the CDC to coordinate data collection activities to maximize the comparability of results. Further, the Department of Health and Human Services must submit an assessment of current activities related to asthma prevention, management, and surveillance that includes recommendations for the future direction of asthma activities.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-21","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-11-22","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8970,"person_hash":"7kmcyqxq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eliot Engel","first_name":"Eliot","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Engel","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-16","ftm_eid":17658812,"votesmart_id":26972,"opensecrets_id":"N00001003","knowwho_pid":158986,"ballotpedia":"Eliot_Engel","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9334,"person_hash":"ivqb9ymw","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Fred Upton","first_name":"Fred","middle_name":"","last_name":"Upton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-6","ftm_eid":2001367,"votesmart_id":26906,"opensecrets_id":"N00004133","knowwho_pid":158900,"ballotpedia":"Fred_Upton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20053,"person_hash":"fu2odj7m","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"TJ Cox","first_name":"TJ","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cox","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-21","ftm_eid":44932483,"votesmart_id":57197,"opensecrets_id":"N00028122","knowwho_pid":629652,"ballotpedia":"TJ_Cox","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9283,"person_hash":"re1xha6c","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Peter King","first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-2","ftm_eid":17658227,"votesmart_id":26968,"opensecrets_id":"N00001193","knowwho_pid":158972,"ballotpedia":"Peter_King","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9033,"person_hash":"6pij8w6c","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Susan Davis","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Davis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-53","ftm_eid":2550215,"votesmart_id":8168,"opensecrets_id":"N00009604","knowwho_pid":193104,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Davis_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18333,"person_hash":"0akuuwt3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Thomas Suozzi","first_name":"Thomas","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Suozzi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-3","ftm_eid":12996931,"votesmart_id":92111,"opensecrets_id":"N00038742","knowwho_pid":462663,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Suozzi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
