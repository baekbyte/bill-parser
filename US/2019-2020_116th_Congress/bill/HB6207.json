If the President issues an emergency declaration or major disaster declaration due to the coronavirus for a state or Indian tribe, the declaration shall be deemed to be a major disaster for the purpose of carrying out provisions regarding unemployment assistance. An individual in an area for which such a declaration is declared shall be eligible for unemployment assistance if he or she has experienced a week of unemployment in such area as a result of the coronavirus; has good cause to voluntarily reduce regular work hours or refuse a bona fide offer of employment, or, in the case of an unemployed self-employed individual, refuses to resume or commence suitable self-employment, for a reason such as illness or incapacity, family crises, or changed individual or family circumstances in the area, as a result of the coronavirus; or is unable to work due to the immediate federal, state, tribal, or local government response to the coronavirus. The assistance authorized for a week of unemployment shall be not less than the weekly amount authorized under the unemployment compensation law of the state for which the disaster declaration was issued. The state unemployment compensation requirement that an individual be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work shall not apply. Compensation shall be made to an individual otherwise eligible without any waiting period.","pending_committee_id":4010,"committee":{"committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-11","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15226,"person_hash":"y42rdobd","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Derek Kilmer","first_name":"Derek","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kilmer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-6","ftm_eid":1230035,"votesmart_id":51516,"opensecrets_id":"N00034453","knowwho_pid":226622,"ballotpedia":"Derek_Kilmer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11135,"person_hash":"92knmuvc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jaime Herrera Beutler","first_name":"Jaime","middle_name":"","last_name":"Herrera Beutler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-3","ftm_eid":2951218,"votesmart_id":101907,"opensecrets_id":"N00031559","knowwho_pid":229353,"ballotpedia":"Jaime_Herrera_Beutler","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18330,"person_hash":"27fxeixn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Rutherford","first_name":"John","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Rutherford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-4","ftm_eid":37039917,"votesmart_id":172542,"opensecrets_id":"N00039777","knowwho_pid":581000,"ballotpedia":"John_Rutherford_(Florida)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3476","sast_bill_id":1359724}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13437,"subject_name":"Emergency management"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13504,"subject_name":"Self-employed"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175004,"date":"2020-03-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6207\/id\/2175004","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6207\/BILLS-116hr6207ih.pdf","text_size":318304,"text_hash":"95bd4dbc8a327565cede22a8aabadcae"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
