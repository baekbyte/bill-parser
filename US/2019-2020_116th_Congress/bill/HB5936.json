The new EIS must consider the environmental effects of all oil or gas development in the planning area. After the new EIS is published, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must review and publish comments regarding the EIS. If the EPA identifies significant environmental impacts or determines that there is insufficient information to assess the environmental impacts of all oil or gas development in the planning area, then the BLM must consult with the EPA before proceeding with federal oil or gas leasing in the planning area.","pending_committee_id":2367,"committee":{"committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
