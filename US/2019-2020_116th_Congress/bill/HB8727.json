Specifically, the bill extends certain flexibilities that were initially authorized during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Among other things, the bill allows (1) rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner); (2) the home of a beneficiary to serve as the originating site (i.e., the location of the beneficiary) for all services (rather than for only certain services); and (3) all types of practitioners to furnish telehealth services, as determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-11-05","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-11-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-11-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-11-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16454,"person_hash":"8v83hjk6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Earl Carter","first_name":"Earl","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Carter","suffix":"","nickname":"Buddy","district":"HD-GA-1","ftm_eid":6806386,"votesmart_id":32085,"opensecrets_id":"N00035346","knowwho_pid":228474,"ballotpedia":"Earl_%22Buddy%22_Carter","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18292,"person_hash":"c8kj8aoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lisa Rochester","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"Blunt","last_name":"Rochester","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DE","ftm_eid":38420440,"votesmart_id":173249,"opensecrets_id":"N00038414","knowwho_pid":558891,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Blunt_Rochester","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9193,"person_hash":"4p9iymg5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cathy McMorris Rodgers","first_name":"Cathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"McMorris Rodgers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-5","ftm_eid":2941046,"votesmart_id":3217,"opensecrets_id":"N00026314","knowwho_pid":199779,"ballotpedia":"Cathy_McMorris_Rodgers","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19693,"person_hash":"wqycx9xg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joseph Morelle","first_name":"Joseph","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Morelle","suffix":"","nickname":"Joe","district":"HD-NY-25","ftm_eid":5413103,"votesmart_id":145182,"opensecrets_id":"N00043207","knowwho_pid":197784,"ballotpedia":"Joseph_Morelle","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20120,"person_hash":"nuddykio","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Van Drew","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Van Drew","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-2","ftm_eid":6389812,"votesmart_id":24685,"opensecrets_id":"N00042164","knowwho_pid":209970,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Van_Drew","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
