Specifically, the bill allows the FDA to request access if the FDA determines that sampling is necessary to facilitate an investigation of a foodborne-illness outbreak, determine the cause of the outbreak, or address other public health needs. The bill provides that such an operation shall be subject to penalties for refusing such a sampling.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-12","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-12-13","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9035,"person_hash":"g25cpbse","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rosa DeLauro","first_name":"Rosa","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"DeLauro","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-3","ftm_eid":5349073,"votesmart_id":26788,"opensecrets_id":"N00000615","knowwho_pid":158778,"ballotpedia":"Rosa_DeLauro","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9134,"person_hash":"g4z5eqp7","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jackie Speier","first_name":"Jackie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Speier","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-14","ftm_eid":12997061,"votesmart_id":8425,"opensecrets_id":"N00029649","knowwho_pid":192997,"ballotpedia":"Jackie_Speier","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15234,"person_hash":"1nzjk413","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Pocan","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pocan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":17658558,"votesmart_id":26238,"opensecrets_id":"N00033549","knowwho_pid":199986,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Pocan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2958","sast_bill_id":1285032}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13130,"subject_name":"Agricultural research"},{"subject_id":13521,"subject_name":"Food supply, safety, and labeling"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13881,"subject_name":"Animal and plant health"},{"subject_id":13552,"subject_name":"Livestock"},{"subject_id":13607,"subject_name":"Meat"},{"subject_id":13753,"subject_name":"Veterinary medicine and animal diseases"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2080598,"date":"2019-12-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5415\/id\/2080598","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5415\/BILLS-116hr5415ih.pdf","text_size":325609,"text_hash":"f5d095d8df7f43f0227cece26b265079"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
