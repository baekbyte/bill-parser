It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and ends the partial DHS shutdown that began on December 22, 2018, because the existing CR expired and the FY2019 DHS appropriations bill has not been enacted. The CR also compensates DHS employees furloughed as a result of any lapse in appropriations that began on or about December 22, 2018, and ended upon the enactment of this joint resolution; reimburses or compensates certain states, federal grantees, and furloughed state employees for the lapse in DHS appropriations; and ratifies and approves certain obligations incurred in anticipation of the appropriations made and the authority granted by this joint resolution. Additionally, the CR has the effect of extending through February 8, 2019, several immigration programs and authorities that were extended in prior CRs and expired on December 21, 2018.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Appropriations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Committee on Appropriations discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Considered under the provisions of rule H.
