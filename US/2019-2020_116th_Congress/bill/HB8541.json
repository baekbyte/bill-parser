Currently, veterans may use specific medical leave for purposes of receiving treatment for service-connected disabilities during the first 12 months of federal employment; unused leave must be forfeited after this period. The bill allows veterans whose first day of federal employment is between March 1, 2019, and June 1, 2021, to use such medical leave during the first 24 months of their employment. The bill also restores forfeited leave to these veterans if treatment was unavailable at a Veterans Affairs medical provider due to COVID-19; restored leave must be used within 12 months of initial forfeiture.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-06","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-06","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-06","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15226,"person_hash":"y42rdobd","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Derek Kilmer","first_name":"Derek","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kilmer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-6","ftm_eid":1230035,"votesmart_id":51516,"opensecrets_id":"N00034453","knowwho_pid":226622,"ballotpedia":"Derek_Kilmer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8964,"person_hash":"2drw2yg6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gerald Connolly","first_name":"Gerald","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Connolly","suffix":"","nickname":"Gerry","district":"HD-VA-11","ftm_eid":16577898,"votesmart_id":95078,"opensecrets_id":"N00029891","knowwho_pid":267105,"ballotpedia":"Gerald_Connolly","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20123,"person_hash":"mv7yhv1z","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jennifer Wexton","first_name":"Jennifer","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wexton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-10","ftm_eid":19907288,"votesmart_id":147013,"opensecrets_id":"N00041002","knowwho_pid":484877,"ballotpedia":"Jennifer_Wexton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13502,"subject_name":"Employee leave"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213960,"date":"2020-11-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8541\/id\/2213960","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8541\/BILLS-116hr8541ih.pdf","text_size":295910,"text_hash":"16306f74216a20d6640195c3660a269b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
