An \"eligible household\" is a household that includes one or more children who are eligible to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs. The amount on each summer EBT card is set at $150 per child in 2020, with adjustments thereafter reflecting changes in reimbursement rates for school meals under the school lunch program. If children are enrolled to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs, they must be enrolled in this program without further application. Summer EBT cards may be used only to purchase food from retail food stores that have been approved for participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program).","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-20","committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-20","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9431,"person_hash":"y4pijgni","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Patty Murray","first_name":"Patty","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murray","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":18930579,"votesmart_id":53358,"opensecrets_id":"N00007876","knowwho_pid":165286,"ballotpedia":"Patty_Murray","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3378","sast_bill_id":1269765}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13315,"subject_name":"Nutrition and diet"},{"subject_id":13259,"subject_name":"Poverty and welfare assistance"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2044188,"date":"2019-06-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1941\/id\/2044188","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1941\/BILLS-116s1941is.pdf","text_size":369376,"text_hash":"88103ebeb3d6ed88cd7b47cd31c6fd9a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
