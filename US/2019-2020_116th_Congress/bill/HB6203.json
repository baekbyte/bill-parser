Specifically, through July 31, 2020, USDA may establish a single waiver of child nutrition program requirements for all states under the National School Lunch Program for purposes of providing meals and snacks with appropriate safety measures due to COVID-19 (States may elect to be subject to a waiver without USDA's approval.), issue a waiver of requirements to allow non-congregate feeding in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and grant a waiver of requirements related to the nutritional content of meals served in child nutrition programs if it determines the waiver is necessary to provide meals and snacks and there is a food supply chain disruption due to COVID-19.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
