Specifically, it increases the rate of the employee retention credit to 80% of up to $15,000 in employee wages per calendar quarter with an increased annual wage cap of $45,000 for all calendar quarters. The bill increases the maximum credit amount to $36,000. The bill expands the definition of large employer, for credit eligibility purposes, to include employers with more than 1,500 employees and more than $41.5 million in gross receipts in 2019, and requires employers to show a significant decline in gross receipts. It also extends eligibility for the credit to state governmental agencies and Indian tribal governments. The bill also coordinates the credit with the Paycheck Protection Program to allow employers to claim both programs subject to certain restrictions.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
