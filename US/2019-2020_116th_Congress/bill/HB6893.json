Specifically, the bill increases funding for paycheck protection loans by $560 billion, and it provides additional funding of $571 billion for paycheck protection loans through FY2021. Further, the bill sets aside $200 billion for paycheck protection loans to businesses and nonprofit organizations with 25 or fewer employees, sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals. The bill also modifies eligibility for the program by (1) making publicly traded companies ineligible to participate, and (2) requiring borrowers to certify a decline in revenue of 20% or more. Further, the bill makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate against or give preferential treatment to any eligible recipient. The Small Business Administration must report on the demographic data, including race, gender, and ethnicity, of paycheck protection loan recipients.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-15","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14082,"person_hash":"7db3fndh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joyce Beatty","first_name":"Joyce","middle_name":"","last_name":"Beatty","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-3","ftm_eid":2954872,"votesmart_id":2427,"opensecrets_id":"N00033904","knowwho_pid":197852,"ballotpedia":"Joyce_Beatty","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9050,"person_hash":"mk25m4b8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Al Green","first_name":"Al","middle_name":"","last_name":"Green","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-9","ftm_eid":11567524,"votesmart_id":49680,"opensecrets_id":"N00026686","knowwho_pid":226547,"ballotpedia":"Al_Green_(Texas)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13504,"subject_name":"Self-employed"},{"subject_id":13275,"subject_name":"Small Business Administration"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2191619,"date":"2020-06-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6893\/id\/2191619","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6893\/BILLS-116hr6893ih.pdf","text_size":311413,"text_hash":"1e4cf63dcbbe6d290fb14f0ac924dff2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
