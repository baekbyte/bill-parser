The bill requires certain disclosures from a foreign issuer of securities that uses, for its required audit report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a foreign public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. If an issuer uses such a foreign public accounting firm, the issuer is generally prohibited from listing its securities on a national securities exchange. Specifically, an issuer that is not currently listed on an exchange and uses such a firm may not be listed. A currently-listed issuer will be delisted beginning in 2025 if the issuer uses such a firm for three consecutive years.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9482,"person_hash":"icw9uwys","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Pat Roberts","first_name":"Pat","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roberts","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-KS","ftm_eid":16368473,"votesmart_id":26866,"opensecrets_id":"N00005285","knowwho_pid":165224,"ballotpedia":"Pat_Roberts","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20297,"person_hash":"9aqi5rh3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rick Scott","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"Rick","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":422306,"votesmart_id":124204,"opensecrets_id":"N00043290","knowwho_pid":289276,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3124","sast_bill_id":1266891},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7007","sast_bill_id":1366996},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7181","sast_bill_id":1369472}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13187,"subject_name":"Financial services and investments"},{"subject_id":13365,"subject_name":"Foreign and international corporations"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13592,"subject_name":"Political parties and affiliation"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13666,"subject_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"},{"subject_id":13616,"subject_name":"U.S. and foreign investments"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2038638,"date":"2019-06-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1731\/id\/2038638","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1731\/BILLS-116s1731is.pdf","text_size":255401,"text_hash":"5eda9f19d990ba75d6b17bcb7a894260"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
