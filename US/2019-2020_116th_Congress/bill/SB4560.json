Eligible remote recreational businesses must (1) have experienced a loss in revenue that is greater than 50% between March 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020, as compared with the same period in the previous year; and (2) show that the closure of the U.S.-Canada border restricted the ability of American customers to access the location of such businesses. The maximum loan amount shall be equal to 75% of the business's FY2019 revenue, and the SBA shall forgive 100% of the value of such loan, less the amount the borrower received from (1) any other loan forgiveness program, or (2) any emergency advance under the economic impact disaster loan program.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-10","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9408,"person_hash":"r7nps3ip","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Amy Klobuchar","first_name":"Amy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klobuchar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":17659011,"votesmart_id":65092,"opensecrets_id":"N00027500","knowwho_pid":248506,"ballotpedia":"Amy_Klobuchar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9431,"person_hash":"y4pijgni","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Patty Murray","first_name":"Patty","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murray","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WA","ftm_eid":18930579,"votesmart_id":53358,"opensecrets_id":"N00007876","knowwho_pid":165286,"ballotpedia":"Patty_Murray","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7845","sast_bill_id":1374830}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13742,"subject_name":"Canada"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13569,"subject_name":"Outdoor recreation"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2208999,"date":"2020-09-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4560\/id\/2208999","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4560\/BILLS-116s4560is.pdf","text_size":300305,"text_hash":"02424f102b8c280ed88a2b9e915344f6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
