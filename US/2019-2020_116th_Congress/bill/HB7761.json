Specifically, an individual who was employed in a public service job and who experiences lapse in employment (e.g., a furlough, a layoff, or the individual's resignation due to illness or caregiving responsibilities) because of the COVID-19 public health emergency may continue to participate in the PSLF program without disruption. The bill treats such an individual as employed in a public service job during the emergency and deems a monthly payment made by the individual as a qualifying monthly payment toward loan cancellation under the PSLF program. However, unless the individual would have completed requirements for loan cancellation during the public health emergency, the individual must resume employment in a public service job within six months after the end of the emergency. In addition, the bill directs the Department of Education to develop and make available guidance related to the assistance provided by the bill.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and
