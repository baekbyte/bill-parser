Energy critical materials means chemicals that have a high risk of a supply disruption and are critical to one or more energy-related technologies; a substantial supply disruption of such material would significantly inhibit large-scale deployment of technologies that produce, transmit, store, or conserve energy. DOE must seek to ensure that any activity receiving funding under the program (1) does not release toxic byproducts into the environment, (2) sufficiently minimizes potential fire risk in facilities where energy storage systems are stored and in the transportation of such systems, and (3) protects the health and safety of all persons involved in or in proximity to such activity.","pending_committee_id":2313,"committee":{"committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-11","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9167,"person_hash":"aaq2jux5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Tonko","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Tonko","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":4469600,"votesmart_id":4403,"opensecrets_id":"N00030196","knowwho_pid":197757,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Tonko","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19436,"person_hash":"4ggjmoax","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Curtis","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Curtis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-3","ftm_eid":6444263,"votesmart_id":123390,"opensecrets_id":"N00041221","knowwho_pid":626323,"ballotpedia":"John_Curtis_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":20692,"subject_name":"Chemistry"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":322387,"subject_name":"Environmental education"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13528,"subject_name":"Environmental technology"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13519,"subject_name":"Hybrid, electric, and advanced technology vehicles"},{"subject_id":20684,"subject_name":"Materials"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13891,"subject_name":"Technology assessment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2208640,"date":"2020-09-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8232\/id\/2208640","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8232\/BILLS-116hr8232ih.pdf","text_size":306513,"text_hash":"17f8032c0b856e345ebb5f9c984e0c7b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
