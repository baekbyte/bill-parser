To be considered a preferred place of accommodation, a hotel, motel, or other place of public accommodation must have certain measures in place, including (1) a zero-tolerance policy regarding severe forms of trafficking in persons, (2) procedures for employees to identify and report such exploitation to appropriate law enforcement authorities and to hotel management, and (3) certain mandatory training for employees who are located at the place of accommodation and who are likely to interact with guests. The General Services Administration shall (1) develop and make available a model zero-tolerance policy for places of accommodation, (2) develop and publish a list of training programs that address the identification of human trafficking and reporting to authorities, and (3) maintain a list of each preferred place of accommodation. Compliance with these requirements shall be assessed and enforced separately for each individual place of accommodation, and a lack of compliance by one shall not impact the eligibility of an affiliated establishment.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-28","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9237,"person_hash":"td566tn1","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Christopher Smith","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-4","ftm_eid":17658186,"votesmart_id":26952,"opensecrets_id":"N00009816","knowwho_pid":158955,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Smith_(New_Jersey)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9086,"person_hash":"1ztgbts1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Carolyn Maloney","first_name":"Carolyn","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-12","ftm_eid":17658243,"votesmart_id":26978,"opensecrets_id":"N00000078","knowwho_pid":158983,"ballotpedia":"Carolyn_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20121,"person_hash":"jgbq6rbf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Waltz","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waltz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-6","ftm_eid":45399438,"votesmart_id":182261,"opensecrets_id":"N00042403","knowwho_pid":652214,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Waltz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13429,"subject_name":"Crime prevention"},{"subject_id":13443,"subject_name":"Crimes against children"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"},{"subject_id":13533,"subject_name":"Travel and tourism"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1959401,"date":"2019-03-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1427\/id\/1959401","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1427\/BILLS-116hr1427ih.pdf","text_size":284069,"text_hash":"f2614a23a7dfc5e1a1b373ac8940165d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
