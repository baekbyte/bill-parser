Mitigation banking is a method of offsetting the effects of development on a species, or habitat of such species, that is endangered, threatened, or otherwise at risk. The bill requires the regulatory standards and criteria, to the extent practicable, to maximize available credits and opportunities for mitigation, provide flexibility for characteristics of various species, and apply equivalent standards and criteria to all mitigation banks.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-15","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2020-09-29","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9389,"person_hash":"8gue0k26","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Wittman","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Wittman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-1","ftm_eid":6666723,"votesmart_id":58133,"opensecrets_id":"N00029459","knowwho_pid":241260,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Wittman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20068,"person_hash":"e1243zkk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debra Haaland","first_name":"Debra","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haaland","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8997515,"votesmart_id":149368,"opensecrets_id":"N00040933","knowwho_pid":491018,"ballotpedia":"Debra_Haaland","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6395","sast_bill_id":1361898},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HR1271","sast_bill_id":1388768}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13150,"subject_name":"Defense spending"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13543,"subject_name":"Endangered and threatened species"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13337,"subject_name":"Wildlife conservation and habitat protection"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2210125,"date":"2020-09-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8263\/id\/2210125","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8263\/BILLS-116hr8263ih.pdf","text_size":295163,"text_hash":"a3418a98ebe3c2cee22450b68a317ee8"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
