Specifically, there must be a presumption of service-connection for veterans who manifest illnesses that have a positive association with exposure to jet fuel, volatile organic compounds, high levels of particulate matter, depleted uranium, asbestos, or lead-based paint, as determined by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded. Veterans who served at K2 Air Base during the specified period are eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for an illness that has been determined by NASEM to have a positive association with exposure to jet fuel, volatile organic compounds, high levels of particulate matter, depleted uranium, asbestos, or lead-based paint. The bill also expands the definition of an open burn pit, for purposes of the VA's open burn pit registry, to include burn pits located on land in Uzbekistan. A burn pit is an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-04","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13244,"subject_name":"Military facilities and property"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":14034,"subject_name":"Uzbekistan"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206617,"date":"2020-08-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4415\/id\/2206617","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4415\/BILLS-116s4415is.pdf","text_size":303556,"text_hash":"a5c76d95fcbf83c0cefa7dd077b827af"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
