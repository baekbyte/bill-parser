The bill increases the maximum federal share of the costs of any activity that may be carried out using grants under the programs to 75%. Currently, the federal share must not exceed 50%. This change is retroactive to December 5, 2018. The U.S. Coast Guard shall properly mark all pierheads belonging to the United States that are located in certain lakes. Additionally, the bill prohibits (1) the Coast Guard from being involved with the installation of lighthouses, and (2) construction of lighthouses, beacons, public piers, or landmarks on any site until a cession of jurisdiction over the same has been made to the United States. The bill eliminates outdated provisions related to the U.S. Lighthouse Service, which was merged into the Coast Guard.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-17","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-10-18","committee_id":2550,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation"},{"date":"2019-12-18","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-12","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
