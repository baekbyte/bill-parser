Specifically, the bill requires the VA to publish the disability benefit questionnaire form in a central location on a VA website. Such a form relates to the submission of evidence by private medical providers regarding the disability of a claimant. If the VA modifies the disability benefit questionnaire form, the VA must accept the previous version of the form filed by a claimant if (1) the claimant files such form during the one-year period following the modification, and (2) the form is signed and dated by the medical provider and is otherwise complete and valid.","pending_committee_id":2597,"committee":{"committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-04-14","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2020-09-16","committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-04-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-04-14","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-23","action":"Committee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15051,"person_hash":"hme4jiwz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Garland Barr","first_name":"Garland","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barr","suffix":"","nickname":"Andy","district":"HD-KY-6","ftm_eid":9192076,"votesmart_id":117290,"opensecrets_id":"N00031233","knowwho_pid":284674,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Barr","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9191,"person_hash":"ejlhf6n6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kenny Marchant","first_name":"Kenny","middle_name":"","last_name":"Marchant","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-24","ftm_eid":13007002,"votesmart_id":5549,"opensecrets_id":"N00026710","knowwho_pid":199221,"ballotpedia":"Kenny_Marchant","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7952","sast_bill_id":1375549}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2179767,"date":"2020-04-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6493\/id\/2179767","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6493\/BILLS-116hr6493ih.pdf","text_size":311346,"text_hash":"331d15a714551cb3449e1eaddc533fed"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2020-07-23","time":"10:00","location":"<\/span>","description":"House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Hearing"}]}}
