It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a partial government shutdown after the existing CR expires on February 15, 2019, because seven of the remaining FY2019 appropriations bills have not been enacted. (Five of the FY2019 appropriations bills were enacted last year, including the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019; the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019; the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2019; and the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019.) Additionally, the CR has the effect of extending through February 22, 2019, several authorities and programs that were extended in prior CRs, including the Violence Against Women Act, the authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to collect and spend certain fees related to pesticides, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and several authorities related to immigration.","pending_committee_id":2298,"committee":{"committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-13","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-13","action":"Introduced
