In providing financial assistance, Reclamation must prioritize projects that (1) prevent the spread of an aquatic invasive species to waters under its jurisdiction, including irrigation, reclamation, or other water projects; and (2) align with the priorities of the state and with the document titled Quagga-Zebra Mussel Action Plan for Western U.S. Waters, published in February 2010. The bill provides authority for each federal agency on the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to (1) conduct mandatory inspections and decontamination of watercraft; and (2) if necessary, impound, quarantine, or otherwise prevent entry of a watercraft. The membership of the task force is expanded to include the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Reclamation.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-02","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-03-03","committee_id":2551,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment"},{"date":"2020-03-10","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-02","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-02","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-02","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20087,"person_hash":"0avwz57i","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben McAdams","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"","last_name":"McAdams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-4","ftm_eid":6501982,"votesmart_id":117512,"opensecrets_id":"N00042013","knowwho_pid":283501,"ballotpedia":"Ben_McAdams","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11144,"person_hash":"ojklk0v4","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Tipton","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tipton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-3","ftm_eid":6022986,"votesmart_id":65403,"opensecrets_id":"N00027509","knowwho_pid":267906,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Tipton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9360,"person_hash":"18i3uo82","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Garamendi","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garamendi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-3","ftm_eid":12997062,"votesmart_id":29664,"opensecrets_id":"N00030856","knowwho_pid":240331,"ballotpedia":"John_Garamendi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2975","sast_bill_id":1286772}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13331,"subject_name":"Aquatic ecology"},{"subject_id":13536,"subject_name":"Arizona"},{"subject_id":13391,"subject_name":"California"},{"subject_id":13539,"subject_name":"Colorado"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13549,"subject_name":"Idaho"},{"subject_id":13584,"subject_name":"Kansas"},{"subject_id":13360,"subject_name":"Marine and inland water transportation"},{"subject_id":13559,"subject_name":"Montana"},{"subject_id":13509,"subject_name":"Nebraska"},{"subject_id":13561,"subject_name":"Nevada"},{"subject_id":13563,"subject_name":"New Mexico"},{"subject_id":13565,"subject_name":"North Dakota"},{"subject_id":13567,"subject_name":"Oklahoma"},{"subject_id":13568,"subject_name":"Oregon"},{"subject_id":13676,"subject_name":"South Dakota"},{"subject_id":13573,"subject_name":"Texas"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13575,"subject_name":"Utah"},{"subject_id":13578,"subject_name":"Washington State"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13393,"subject_name":"Water storage"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"},{"subject_id":13582,"subject_name":"Wyoming"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2165080,"date":"2020-03-07","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6057\/id\/2165080","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6057\/BILLS-116hr6057ih.pdf","text_size":325347,"text_hash":"ff4b04b91756cddfa1d629ad7acd4cc6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
