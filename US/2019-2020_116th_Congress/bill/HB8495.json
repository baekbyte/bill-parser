The prohibition shall apply to any financial instrument that represents Russian sovereign debt that has a maturity or duration period of at least 14 days, including (1) bonds issued by the Russian Central Bank, the Russian National Wealth Fund, or the Russian Federal Treasury; and (2) foreign exchange swap agreements with such entities. The President may suspend this prohibition if the President reports to Congress a determination that there is no significant evidence to determine that Russia's government (or its agents) knowingly engaged in interference of any federal election since the most recent prior regularly scheduled federal election. The President may also waive the application of the prohibition for national security purposes. If the President seeks a waiver on or before February 1, 2021, the waiver shall apply only if Congress passes a joint resolution supporting the waiver. The bill also requires the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress and the President no later than 90 days after a regularly scheduled federal election on whether there is significant evidence to determine whether Russia's government or its agents knowingly engaged in interference of that election.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-01","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence (Permanent Select), and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence (Permanent Select), and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence (Permanent Select), and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence (Permanent Select), and Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8989,"person_hash":"qrk1gvtk","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brad Sherman","first_name":"Brad","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sherman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-30","ftm_eid":369166,"votesmart_id":142,"opensecrets_id":"N00006897","knowwho_pid":158741,"ballotpedia":"Brad_Sherman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9144,"person_hash":"ijja8k71","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Maxine Waters","first_name":"Maxine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waters","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-43","ftm_eid":1257359,"votesmart_id":26759,"opensecrets_id":"N00006690","knowwho_pid":158752,"ballotpedia":"Maxine_Waters","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9086,"person_hash":"1ztgbts1","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Carolyn Maloney","first_name":"Carolyn","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Maloney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-12","ftm_eid":17658243,"votesmart_id":26978,"opensecrets_id":"N00000078","knowwho_pid":158983,"ballotpedia":"Carolyn_Maloney","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9050,"person_hash":"mk25m4b8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Al Green","first_name":"Al","middle_name":"","last_name":"Green","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-9","ftm_eid":11567524,"votesmart_id":49680,"opensecrets_id":"N00026686","knowwho_pid":226547,"ballotpedia":"Al_Green_(Texas)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
