Specifically, HHS must award grants to (1) health professions schools, state or local governments, or nonprofits to provide training for health care providers on suicide prevention, other behavioral health issues, and strategies to improve well-being; and (2) health care providers, prioritizing those in COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) hot spots, to establish or expand programs to promote mental and behavioral health among health care providers involved with COVID-19 response efforts. HHS must also study issues related to, and develop policy recommendations on, preventing burnout and improving mental and behavioral health among health care providers, removing barriers to accessing care and treatment, and identifying strategies to promote resiliency. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must conduct a campaign to encourage health care providers to seek support and treatment for mental and behavioral health concerns.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20099,"person_hash":"0ofzojv3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Max Rose","first_name":"Max","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rose","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-11","ftm_eid":44044919,"votesmart_id":180409,"opensecrets_id":"N00041588","knowwho_pid":632434,"ballotpedia":"Max_Rose","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11063,"person_hash":"zxbr0ie0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David McKinley","first_name":"David","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"McKinley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WV-1","ftm_eid":7565199,"votesmart_id":117396,"opensecrets_id":"N00031681","knowwho_pid":284510,"ballotpedia":"David_McKinley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20043,"person_hash":"q9j3ocdj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brindisi","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Brindisi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-22","ftm_eid":13009387,"votesmart_id":135258,"opensecrets_id":"N00041385","knowwho_pid":359075,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brindisi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20097,"person_hash":"grn495qr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Denver Riggleman","first_name":"Denver","middle_name":"","last_name":"Riggleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-5","ftm_eid":37981574,"votesmart_id":181445,"opensecrets_id":"N00043541","knowwho_pid":613877,"ballotpedia":"Denver_Riggleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20052,"person_hash":"lmg91h6p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gil Cisneros","first_name":"Gil","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cisneros","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-39","ftm_eid":17779260,"votesmart_id":179370,"opensecrets_id":"N00041464","knowwho_pid":631203,"ballotpedia":"Gil_Cisneros","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
