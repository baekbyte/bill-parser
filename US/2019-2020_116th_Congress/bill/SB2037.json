Additionally, the bill authorizes grants under the program for the creation of new programs for the development of Native American STEM professionals. The bill also revises how programs are prioritized for awarding grants. The bill gives priority to programs in which 70% or more of the participants are Native Americans.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-27","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9491,"person_hash":"isieh7x3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lisa Murkowski","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murkowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":6604204,"votesmart_id":15841,"opensecrets_id":"N00026050","knowwho_pid":192554,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Murkowski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4222","sast_bill_id":1273584}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13780,"subject_name":"Alaska Natives and Hawaiians"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13655,"subject_name":"Science and engineering education"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2045812,"date":"2019-07-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2037\/id\/2045812","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2037\/BILLS-116s2037is.pdf","text_size":365082,"text_hash":"22543587600d0d681ac190ff527ba396"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
