The resolution encourages (1) DOD to complete its full audit before the end of the year and report back to Congress immediately; and (2) the Department of State and other agencies to ensure U.S. safety through diplomacy, foreign assistance, and a strong economy.","pending_committee_id":2299,"committee":{"committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed
