The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must, upon request, provide a community with appropriate data to assist in preparation of the required plan. In making decisions with respect to awarding flood risk mitigation grants, FEMA may consider the extent to which a community has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas. A community that does not comply with these requirements may be subject to appropriate sanctions.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial
