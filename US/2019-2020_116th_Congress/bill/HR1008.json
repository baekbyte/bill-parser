convey instances of abuse against the Iranian American community; calls upon law enforcement authorities to investigate and vigorously prosecute crimes committed against Americans that are based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity; urges the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the Department of Homeland Security to conclude a thorough and timely investigation into detentions of Iranian Americans at the border; and calls on Customs and Border Protection to immediately halt any orders that encourage discrimination on the basis of nationality or
