Specifically, the bill establishes a professional exchange program comprised of both an annual educational forum for scholars from the United States and India, as well as an undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate student exchange for students in the United States and India. The bill also establishes a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution tools based on the principles of nonviolence. Further, the bill establishes the United States-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation to identify development priorities in India (e.g., pollution and climate change, education, and tuberculosis) and administer competitively awarded grants to nongovernmental entities to address those priorities.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-19","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},{"date":"2020-01-14","committee_id":4127,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation"},{"date":"2020-12-07","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-19","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Mr. Engel moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
