Specifically, the bill prohibits IHEs from (1) allowing any individual to agree to a liability waiver for any sporting activity, or (2) canceling a scholarship or any other financial aid provided to a college athlete who does not participate in team activities due to concerns about COVID-19. Further, each IHE must inform its college athletes when a college athlete or a staff member of its athletic department tests positive for COVID-19, without revealing any personally identifiable information about the individual. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must, within 90 days, develop health and safety guidelines related to COVID-19 for athletic departments of IHEs. IHEs must comply with these guidelines. The bill also provides a private right of action for individuals affected by violations of the bill.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-30","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13609,"subject_name":"Athletes"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13702,"subject_name":"School athletics"},{"subject_id":13708,"subject_name":"State and local courts"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2202359,"date":"2020-07-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4102\/id\/2202359","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4102\/BILLS-116s4102is.pdf","text_size":301848,"text_hash":"71cf8a5147547db47a8a4a5fe7627e4a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
