The CFATS program requires chemical facilities to assess and address their threat vulnerabilities. The bill requires DHS to (1) verify information submitted by a covered chemical facility prior to assigning such facility a lower risk tier or determining that such facility no longer presents a high level of security risk, and (2) develop a voluntary program for chemical facilities to address potential security risks. DHS shall, among other things (1) provide for an annual review of a facility's compliance with its emergency response plan; (2) make available to state, local, and regional fusion centers and state and local government officials such information as it deems necessary to ensure that emergency response providers are prepared and provided with the situational awareness needed to respond to security incidents; and (3) establish a Chemical Security Advisory Committee to advise DHS on the implementation of this bill. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shall (1) conduct a review of potential effects of attacks on covered chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure; and (2) establish a secure communications and information technology infrastructure or platform that allows facility owners and operators to voluntarily report on emerging threats, including terrorism threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems (i.e., drones) to covered chemical facilities. The Government Accountability Office shall evaluate the effectiveness of DHS risk-based performance standards.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2306,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Homeland Security"},{"date":"2019-06-14","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},{"date":"2019-06-18","committee_id":3983,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-18","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-19","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 14 - 12.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-12","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Homeland Security.
