Under the program, USDA may not permit forest botanical products to be harvested in excess of sustainable harvest levels. Collected fees must be in an amount to recover a portion of the fair market value of the harvested forest botanical products and a portion of all of the costs incurred by USDA that are associated with the granting, modifying, or monitoring of the authorization for harvest of the products, including the costs of any environmental or other analysis. USDA must establish a personal use harvest level for each forest botanical product. The harvesting of a forest botanical product below that level by a person for personal use shall not be subject to the charges and fees under this bill. USDA shall (1) conduct analyses to determine whether and how the harvest of forest botanical products on NFS lands can be conducted on a sustainable basis, and (2) establish procedures and timeframes for monitoring and revising the harvest levels established for such products. Funds collected under the program shall be expended at NFS units to pay for the costs of conducting inventories of forest botanical products, determining sustainable levels of harvest, monitoring and assessing the impacts of harvest levels and methods, restoration activities, and authorizing harvest.","pending_committee_id":3247,"committee":{"committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-17","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-09-26","committee_id":3991,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands"},{"date":"2020-01-23","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-17","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-17","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Natural Resources, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-23","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11135,"person_hash":"92knmuvc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jaime Herrera Beutler","first_name":"Jaime","middle_name":"","last_name":"Herrera Beutler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-3","ftm_eid":2951218,"votesmart_id":101907,"opensecrets_id":"N00031559","knowwho_pid":229353,"ballotpedia":"Jaime_Herrera_Beutler","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9321,"person_hash":"2rjgzh6l","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kurt Schrader","first_name":"Kurt","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schrader","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OR-5","ftm_eid":22206618,"votesmart_id":10813,"opensecrets_id":"N00030071","knowwho_pid":198136,"ballotpedia":"Kurt_Schrader","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13395,"subject_name":"Public lands and natural resources"},{"subject_id":13129,"subject_name":"Agricultural conservation and pollution"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":22687,"subject_name":"Forests, forestry, trees"},{"subject_id":13548,"subject_name":"Horticulture and plants"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2054961,"date":"2019-09-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4357\/id\/2054961","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4357\/BILLS-116hr4357ih.pdf","text_size":355851,"text_hash":"0c662374c98fad1f1175370e52f1119b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
