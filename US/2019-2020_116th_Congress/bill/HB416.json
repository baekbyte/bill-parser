Specifically, the bill requires DOJ to report annually on the amount of total deposits into the fund that are derived from Mexican cartels. It makes available 50% of that amount for the construction of additional physical barriers and roads near the border to deter illegal crossings into the United States. Additionally, the bill prohibits the release of seized currency or contraband that likely belongs to or supports a foreign, illegal trafficking organization while a civil forfeiture action is pending.","pending_committee_id":2349,"committee":{"committee_id":2349,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-09","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9232,"person_hash":"aiyghgq9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Sensenbrenner","first_name":"F.
