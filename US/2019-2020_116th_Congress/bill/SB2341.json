Among other things, the bill requires the Department of Transportation to implement regulations relating to protections for airline passengers from being required to involuntarily relinquish their seats, unless necessary for safety or security; the elimination of the dollar limitations on compensation to passengers denied boarding due to overbooking; compensation to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights; interline agreements between air carriers and other transportation providers; training on the rights of passengers; unreasonable air carrier fees; unrestricted access of consumers to information on schedules, fares, fees, and taxes; accuracy in pricing of tickets and disclosure of lowest fares; and notifications to passengers of their rights and eligibility for refunds. The Federal Aviation Administration must (1) prohibit any air carrier from reducing seat size or leg room, and (2) report on the quality of food and potable water on passenger aircraft and the sufficiency of flight crews and aircraft. The bill provides a private right of action for passengers aggrieved by airline actions and increases civil penalties on air carriers for violations of passenger protections.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And
