Specifically, the bill requires USDA to notify authorized program retailers of existing opportunities through which they can deliver food to SNAP participants, including allowing an electronic benefit transfer card to be swiped on delivery of food to the home (with a mobile device); authorizes public-private partnerships between USDA, authorized program retailers, and community-based organizations to support food delivery, including through the use of private funds; provides funding, which USDA must use to reimburse certain retailers for the costs of delivering food to program participants who are seniors, immunocompromised individuals, or other individuals who are unable to travel safely to a program retailer; and requires each state to submit a plan that describes how it will coordinate with program retailers and community-based partners to expand delivery, administer reimbursements, and ensure retailers meet eligibility requirements. Authority for USDA to carry out the bill with respect to each state shall terminate on the later of (1) the date on which the national emergency declared by the President with respect to COVID-19 is terminated, and (2) the date on which the state emergency declared in such state with respect to COVID-19 is terminated.","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-14","committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB6904","sast_bill_id":1366093}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13128,"subject_name":"Aging"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13763,"subject_name":"Community life and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":13511,"subject_name":"Food industry and services"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":81056,"subject_name":"Immunology and vaccination"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13234,"subject_name":"Labor standards"},{"subject_id":13551,"subject_name":"Labor-management relations"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13523,"subject_name":"Retail and wholesale trades"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2192306,"date":"2020-06-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3736\/id\/2192306","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3736\/BILLS-116s3736is.pdf","text_size":318200,"text_hash":"0d9f107e60cdaa5a99214fae5aa1b989"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
