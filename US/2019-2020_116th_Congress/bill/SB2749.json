The bill directs CISA to make .gov domain name registration services, as well as supporting services, generally available to any federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government entity, or other publicly controlled entity that complies with the policies for registration developed by CISA. CISA shall inventory all host names and services in active use within the .gov domain and provide the data to domain registrants at no cost. CISA shall develop and submit to Congress (1) a strategy to utilize information collected for countering malicious cyber activity; (2) an outreach strategy to local, tribal, and territorial governments and other publicly controlled entities to inform and support migration to the .gov domain; and (3) a .gov domain security enhancement strategy and implementation plan.
