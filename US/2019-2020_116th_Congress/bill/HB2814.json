Specifically, the Department of Defense must provide to a service member serving in the U.S. Virgin Islands the basic housing allowance, rather than the overseas housing allowance. Currently, a service member on duty in the U.S. Virgin Islands receives the overseas housing allowance, which is limited to cost reimbursement. By contrast, service members in the 50 states and the District of Columbia receive the basic housing allowance, which offers a fixed amount for each locality and grade\/rank.","pending_committee_id":2361,"committee":{"committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-16","committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"},{"date":"2019-05-17","committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Armed Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-17","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16824,"person_hash":"le3tseyc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Stacey Plaskett","first_name":"Stacey","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Plaskett","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VI","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":155929,"opensecrets_id":"N00035000","knowwho_pid":439826,"ballotpedia":"Stacey_Plaskett","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"},{"subject_id":13296,"subject_name":"Virgin Islands"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2033093,"date":"2019-06-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2814\/id\/2033093","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2814\/BILLS-116hr2814ih.pdf","text_size":244273,"text_hash":"9521dc87d140340d09fd64c6f72cf831"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
