Currently, individuals may file such a complaint through a state-based administrative procedure. Further, DOJ must immediately provide (1) a copy of the complaint to the entity responsible for administering the state-based administrative complaint procedure for the state involved in such complaint, and (2) a copy of the response to such entity. The bill also permits such an individual, including an individual who seeks to enforce their right to a voter-verified ballot, to file a civil action for deprivation of rights.","pending_committee_id":2307,"committee":{"committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-05","committee_id":2307,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-05","action":"Referred to the House Committee on House Administration.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20054,"person_hash":"ue5szndm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sharice Davids","first_name":"Sharice","middle_name":"","last_name":"Davids","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-3","ftm_eid":15561443,"votesmart_id":181201,"opensecrets_id":"N00042626","knowwho_pid":655850,"ballotpedia":"Sharice_Davids","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1275","sast_bill_id":1205620},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB549","sast_bill_id":1217483},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB949","sast_bill_id":1246563},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1","sast_bill_id":1137322}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13494,"subject_name":"Elections, voting, political campaign regulation"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13434,"subject_name":"Voting rights"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1966799,"date":"2019-03-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1513\/id\/1966799","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1513\/BILLS-116hr1513ih.pdf","text_size":156651,"text_hash":"2940ea607acd8d797aa7c8b4f795ec01"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
