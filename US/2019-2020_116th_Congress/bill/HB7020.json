Specifically, individuals may bring a cause of action in U.S. district court against any person for harm suffered as a result of a violation of, or a failure to comply with, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) or the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Further, during the COVID-19 public health emergency period and 180 days thereafter, no predispute arbitration agreement or joint-action waiver (an agreement to waive the right to participate in a
