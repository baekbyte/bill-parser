A covered call is generally one that (1) is made by an automatic dialing system, (2) uses an artificial or prerecorded voice and is not initiated for emergency purposes, or (3) violates the do-not-call-registry. The FTC must provide monetary compensation for the identification and prevention of covered calls and enable participants to share funds recovered from violations.","pending_committee_id":4134,"committee":{"committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-15","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-02-19","committee_id":4134,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Consumer Protection and Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-19","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16503,"person_hash":"4z13x8m3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Garret Graves","first_name":"Garret","middle_name":"","last_name":"Graves","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-6","ftm_eid":26395838,"votesmart_id":155424,"opensecrets_id":"N00036135","knowwho_pid":160828,"ballotpedia":"Garret_Graves","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18298,"person_hash":"reoz38xt","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Charlie Crist","first_name":"Charlie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crist","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-13","ftm_eid":1736080,"votesmart_id":24311,"opensecrets_id":"N00002942","knowwho_pid":218595,"ballotpedia":"Charlie_Crist","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14902,"person_hash":"tzhhvy6i","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Meadows","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Meadows","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-11","ftm_eid":5904346,"votesmart_id":136459,"opensecrets_id":"N00033631","knowwho_pid":378689,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Meadows_(North_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13634,"subject_name":"Federal Communications Commission (FCC)"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1942721,"date":"2019-03-02","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1304\/id\/1942721","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1304\/BILLS-116hr1304ih.pdf","text_size":278877,"text_hash":"d4fe44a4e0dddb7b646753aaba44e89b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
