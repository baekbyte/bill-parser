The lactation room must be shielded from public view, be free from intrusion, and contain a chair, a working surface, and (if the building is supplied with electricity) an electrical outlet. A public building may be excluded from such requirement at the discretion of the official responsible for its operation if it does not contain a lactation room for employees and does not have a space that could be repurposed as one or that could be made private by using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or the cost of new construction required to create a lactation room is not feasible.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-30","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-30","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
