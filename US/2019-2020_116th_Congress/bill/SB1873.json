(The Jones Act requires vessels transporting merchandise or passengers between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports to be built in the Unites States, at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens, and mostly crewed by U.S. citizens.) Specifically, the bill requires the head of a federal agency to temporarily waive Jones Act requirements upon request if (1) there is no product carrier that meets such requirements, and (2) a good faith effort was made to locate a product carrier that complies with such requirements; approve or deny a waiver within 60 days after receiving a request; and notify Congress of any request it receives for a temporary waiver.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11909,"person_hash":"yhq11h7j","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Lee","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-UT","ftm_eid":19890610,"votesmart_id":66395,"opensecrets_id":"N00031696","knowwho_pid":268656,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Lee_(Utah)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13360,"subject_name":"Marine and inland water transportation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2041418,"date":"2019-06-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1873\/id\/2041418","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1873\/BILLS-116s1873is.pdf","text_size":126808,"text_hash":"3a2d79d0e1077ebb57da67d7f781e7aa"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
