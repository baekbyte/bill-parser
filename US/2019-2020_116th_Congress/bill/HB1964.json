Members of the tribe residing in Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland counties in North Carolina are deemed to be within the delivery area for such services.

Interior may take land into trust for the benefit of the tribe. Finally, North Carolina must exercise jurisdiction over all criminal offenses committed, and all civil actions that arise, on North Carolina lands owned by, or held in trust for, the Lumbee Tribe or any dependent Indian community of the tribe unless jurisdiction is transferred to the United States pursuant to an agreement between the tribe and the state.","pending_committee_id":2335,"committee":{"committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-04-17","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},{"date":"2020-11-17","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-17","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-04","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-30","action":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-30","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-30","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-11-16","action":"Mr. Huffman moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-11-16","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
