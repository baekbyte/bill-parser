The bill establishes a National Wildlife Corridor System and provides for the designation and management of such corridors on federal land and water. A corridor means a feature of the landscape or seascape that (1) provides habitat or ecological connectivity, and (2) allows for movement or dispersal of native fish, wildlife, or plants. Indian tribes may nominate a corridor within their land to be included in a Tribal Wildlife Corridor. In addition, the bill establishes a Wildlife Corridors Stewardship Fund to receive donations for the management and protection of the corridors. It also establishes a wildlife movement grant program to encourage the passage of native fish, wildlife, or plant species across a landscape or seascape. The National Coordination Committee, established by this bill, must recommend projects to fund under the grant program. The committee must also develop standards for regional wildlife movement plans to allow for better cross-regional collaboration. No fewer than four regional wildlife movement councils must be established. Among other things, the councils must submit to the committee regional wildlife movement plans as well as lists of funding priorities. Finally, the U.S. Geological Survey must establish a National Wildlife Corridors Database.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-16","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-05-17","committee_id":2360,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Readiness"},{"date":"2019-06-03","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},{"date":"2019-06-10","committee_id":3247,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Conservation and Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, Armed Services, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, Armed Services, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, Armed Services, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-16","action":"Referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, Armed Services, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-17","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Readiness.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-17","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-10","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-17","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 22 - 15.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-09","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources.
