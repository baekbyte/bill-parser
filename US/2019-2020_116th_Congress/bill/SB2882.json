In awarding grants, FEMA must give priority to state and local governments, Indian tribes, and joint authorities that will carry out projects or plans supporting a low-income community in a fire-hazard area or a severe disaster impacted community in a fire-hazard area. The GAO shall publish (1) a report on authorities and programs that are available to protect communities from wildfires; and (2) a study on the potential for a community wildfire defense plan to qualify for a certification identifying a level of wildfire survivability and resilience, and how to incentivize insurance companies to accept the certification. The Forest Service shall develop and publish a map depicting at-risk communities. FEMA shall prepare a report relating to insufficient radio frequencies, barriers to interoperability of radio frequencies, and available products and technologies for overcoming barriers to interoperability for wildland fire management.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-18","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-18","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18329,"person_hash":"jgkrx0ce","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jacky Rosen","first_name":"Jacky","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rosen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":39827617,"votesmart_id":169471,"opensecrets_id":"N00038734","knowwho_pid":567336,"ballotpedia":"Jacky_Rosen","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5091","sast_bill_id":1280565}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13437,"subject_name":"Emergency management"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13495,"subject_name":"Emergency communications systems"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":22687,"subject_name":"Forests, forestry, trees"},{"subject_id":321582,"subject_name":"Geography and mapping"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2070672,"date":"2019-11-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2882\/id\/2070672","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2882\/BILLS-116s2882is.pdf","text_size":340534,"text_hash":"5c9eb415faa59d50b02e55ca63958fc2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
