It also condemns (1) the Hong Kong government's use of force against the demonstrators, (2) the government's characterizations of the protests as \"riots\" and attempts to blame the United States for the city's political situation, and (3) Chinese state media for targeting staff and family members of the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong. (Hong Kong is a part of China but has a mostly separate legal system, which includes protection for civil liberties including freedom from arbitrary imprisonment. Protests sprung up in opposition to the introduction of an extradition bill that critics say would allow extradition to jurisdictions that do not have such protections, in particular mainland China.)","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-30","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Ordered to be Reported in the Nature of a Substitute by Unanimous Consent.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-15","action":"Mr. Sherman moved to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-15","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
