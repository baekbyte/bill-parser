The PLUM Book contains personnel information for federal civil service leadership and support positions in the legislative and executive branches that may be subject to noncompetitive appointment, including heads of agencies and policy executives. The book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions and is published every four years (after each presidential election) by certain congressional committees. The bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to publish the information contained in the PLUM Book on a public website in a format that is easily searchable and that otherwise meets certain data standards. Agencies must upload updated information to the website on a biennial basis. OPM must verify the accuracy of the website's information 90 days after its creation, in coordination with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. The bill terminates publication of the PLUM Book in its current form on January 1, 2024.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-04","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-04","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-22","action":"Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
