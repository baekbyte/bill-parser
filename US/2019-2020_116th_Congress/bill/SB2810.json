Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded. Per the bill, certain veterans with diagnosed hearing loss, tinnitus, or both shall be presumed to have incurred or aggravated such conditions during active military, naval, or air service. applies to veterans who (1) served in combat, or (2) were assigned to a military occupational specialty that likely exposed them to a sufficiently high level of acoustic trauma. The bill also requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to adjust the schedule of rating disabilities to establish a minimum disability rating for a veteran who requires a hearing aid because of a service-connected disability.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-07","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-07","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Star Print ordered on the bill.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3866","sast_bill_id":1271789}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13608,"subject_name":"Hearing, speech, and vision care"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2067999,"date":"2019-11-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2810\/id\/2067999","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2810\/BILLS-116s2810is.pdf","text_size":327906,"text_hash":"ff8378408aad69e7f6537a8deb31fd7d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
