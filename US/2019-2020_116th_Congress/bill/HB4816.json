Specifically, the bill extends protections from retaliation to individuals who (1) assist in a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation of these violations, (2) make disclosures that are required or protected under any law subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction, or (3) provide information to supervisors or other employees with the authority to investigate potential misconduct. Currently, these protections apply only to individuals who report information directly to the CFTC. The bill also provides for the processing of these whistleblower awards no later than one year after the deadline to file a claim.","pending_committee_id":3246,"committee":{"committee_id":3246,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-23","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-11-13","committee_id":3246,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Referred to the Committee on Agriculture, and in addition to the Committee on Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20041,"person_hash":"3n1sakj2","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cindy Axne","first_name":"Cindy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Axne","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-3","ftm_eid":44044592,"votesmart_id":179226,"opensecrets_id":"N00041104","knowwho_pid":627442,"ballotpedia":"Cindy_Axne","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2529","sast_bill_id":1275266},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4895","sast_bill_id":1278536},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6197","sast_bill_id":1359181}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13768,"subject_name":"Business ethics"},{"subject_id":13790,"subject_name":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13805,"subject_name":"Commodities markets"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2059230,"date":"2019-10-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4816\/id\/2059230","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4816\/BILLS-116hr4816ih.pdf","text_size":338800,"text_hash":"b6de57924745991d208d78c99c82bf0d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
