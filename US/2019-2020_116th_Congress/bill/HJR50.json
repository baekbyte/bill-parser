The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. The amendment requires a three-fifths vote of each chamber of Congress to increase revenue or increase the limit on the debt of the United States. The President must submit an annual budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts and that includes justifications and specified details regarding funding proposed for departments and agencies. Congress may waive the requirements due to a declaration of war, a military conflict, an event that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security, or a natural disaster.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-12","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-04-08","committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14906,"person_hash":"4hczcvbn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Perry","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-4","ftm_eid":13005805,"votesmart_id":59980,"opensecrets_id":"N00034120","knowwho_pid":248703,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Perry","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11049,"person_hash":"tzdxxeto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeff Duncan","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duncan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-3","ftm_eid":8045191,"votesmart_id":47967,"opensecrets_id":"N00030752","knowwho_pid":213970,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Duncan_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9197,"person_hash":"cw1v2ewn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Posey","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-8","ftm_eid":12998616,"votesmart_id":24280,"opensecrets_id":"N00029662","knowwho_pid":193543,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Posey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR6","sast_bill_id":1137332},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HJR22","sast_bill_id":1141992}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1958060,"date":"2019-03-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HJR50\/id\/1958060","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hjres50\/BILLS-116hjres50ih.pdf","text_size":153946,"text_hash":"dffe0380f533e85d9be8ac0c73513fa5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
