A state that has been redistricted after an apportionment of Representatives may not be redistricted again until after the next apportionment, unless the state is ordered by a court to conduct a subsequent redistricting in order to comply with the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Each state must establish an independent redistricting commission to develop redistricting plans that meet specified criteria. If such a plan is not enacted into law, a state's highest court may select a plan developed by the state's commission. If the state court does not select a plan, a U.S. district court must develop a plan. The Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states to carry out redistricting.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9068,"person_hash":"ludkkyov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sheila Jackson-Lee","first_name":"Sheila","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jackson-Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-18","ftm_eid":6716263,"votesmart_id":21692,"opensecrets_id":"N00005818","knowwho_pid":159088,"ballotpedia":"Sheila_Jackson_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15238,"person_hash":"ljvyxtoc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eric Swalwell","first_name":"Eric","middle_name":"","last_name":"Swalwell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-15","ftm_eid":15742560,"votesmart_id":129529,"opensecrets_id":"N00033508","knowwho_pid":378800,"ballotpedia":"Eric_Swalwell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB44","sast_bill_id":1137450},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB130","sast_bill_id":1137459}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13525,"subject_name":"Congress"},{"subject_id":20691,"subject_name":"Congressional districts and representation"},{"subject_id":13364,"subject_name":"Constitution and constitutional amendments"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13590,"subject_name":"House of Representatives"},{"subject_id":13588,"subject_name":"Members of Congress"},{"subject_id":13708,"subject_name":"State and local courts"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13434,"subject_name":"Voting rights"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1850562,"date":"2019-01-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB124\/id\/1850562","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr124\/BILLS-116hr124ih.pdf","text_size":274264,"text_hash":"a334e0825a5eba1fcaeb687ef39a85cc"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
