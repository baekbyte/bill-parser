A HUBZone small business is a small business in a historically underutilized business zone. Currently, HUBZone status appeals are the responsibility of the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development. The bill would place HUBZone status appeals within the purview of the OHA alongside other SBA programs such as the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program and the Women-Owned Small Business program.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-11","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},{"date":"2020-12-07","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-11","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-16","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Ms. Velazquez moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
