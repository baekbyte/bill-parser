The bill allows territories to terminate their public, unsecured debt if they meet two of three criteria: the population of the territory has decreased by more than 5% over 10 years, the territory received major federal disaster assistance, or the territory's per capita debt exceeds $15,000. If Puerto Rico discharges its debt under this process, the bill provides funding that a special master must allocate to certain creditors whose debts were discharged. The bill also establishes a Puerto Rico Public Credit Comprehensive Audit Commission.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-02","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9434,"person_hash":"tz8vuv7x","party_id":"3","state_id":52,"party":"I","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bernard Sanders","first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VT","ftm_eid":9960190,"votesmart_id":27110,"opensecrets_id":"N00000528","knowwho_pid":159116,"ballotpedia":"Bernie_Sanders","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18412,"person_hash":"nxsqmyve","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kamala Harris","first_name":"Kamala","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Harris","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CA","ftm_eid":21642,"votesmart_id":120012,"opensecrets_id":"N00036915","knowwho_pid":314474,"ballotpedia":"Kamala_Harris","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB2526","sast_bill_id":1256705}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13489,"subject_name":"Caribbean area"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13659,"subject_name":"Federal district courts"},{"subject_id":13397,"subject_name":"Government liability"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13418,"subject_name":"Judicial review and appeals"},{"subject_id":13445,"subject_name":"Jurisdiction and venue"},{"subject_id":13263,"subject_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2015801,"date":"2019-05-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1312\/id\/2015801","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1312\/BILLS-116s1312is.pdf","text_size":411881,"text_hash":"340d46398bc67772b297eea661fc656a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
