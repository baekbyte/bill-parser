The fee is imposed on producers and importers of such fuels and is deposited into a Climate Action Rebate Fund established by this bill. The bill establishes an gradual emissions reduction schedule for such fuels between 2020 and 2050 (100% reduction). The bill requires payment of an equalization fee by fossil fuels and carbon-intensive imported goods at the border and provides for refunds of comparable exports. The bill rebates up to 70% of net revenues from the fund to low-income individuals as a monthly dividend. Remaining revenues must be used for investment in infrastructure, energy innovation, and assistance for workers and communities to transition to a cleaner energy economy. All carbon fee revenue must be spent in accordance with Buy American requirements and the Davis-Bacon Act (requires payment of local prevailing wage on public works projects for laborers and mechanics),","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Read
