DOT may provide competitive grants to states, local, or tribal government entities for projects that improve the functioning of traffic signals to (1) reduce traffic congestion, (2) improve the safety and effectiveness of roadways, (3) reduce fuel costs for drivers, and (4) reduce air pollution. Grants may not be used to purchase, operate, or maintain an automated traffic enforcement system. The federal share of project costs may not exceed 80%, but DOT may waive such limit if an assisted entity can show extreme financial hardship.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-06-14","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-14","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15217,"person_hash":"ti9w2cwq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tony Cardenas","first_name":"Tony","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cardenas","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-29","ftm_eid":17657742,"votesmart_id":9754,"opensecrets_id":"N00033373","knowwho_pid":193068,"ballotpedia":"Tony_C%C3%A1rdenas","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18301,"person_hash":"n4tj3j3m","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Adriano Espaillat","first_name":"Adriano","middle_name":"","last_name":"Espaillat","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-13","ftm_eid":6512516,"votesmart_id":14379,"opensecrets_id":"N00034549","knowwho_pid":197725,"ballotpedia":"Adriano_Espaillat","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11606,"person_hash":"xk5qn52a","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Schweikert","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schweikert","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-6","ftm_eid":8573431,"votesmart_id":106387,"opensecrets_id":"N00006460","knowwho_pid":267202,"ballotpedia":"David_Schweikert","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2041856,"date":"2019-06-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3261\/id\/2041856","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3261\/BILLS-116hr3261ih.pdf","text_size":126549,"text_hash":"703271864fdf34060b7642ab0e162c9b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
