Currently, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) requires DOJ to compensate state and localities for the costs for incarcerating an undocumented criminal alien. The bill expands SCAAP to require DOJ to provide compensation for incarcerating aliens whose immigration status cannot be definitively identified. The bill also expands the definition of an \"undocumented criminal alien\" to include qualifying aliens who were charged with a felony or two misdemeanors, where the statute currently requires convictions of such crimes.The bill also authorizes the program through FY2024.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-14","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9444,"person_hash":"0ie58qto","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cornyn","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cornyn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TX","ftm_eid":6646197,"votesmart_id":15375,"opensecrets_id":"N00024852","knowwho_pid":211675,"ballotpedia":"John_Cornyn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13346,"subject_name":"Immigration"},{"subject_id":13136,"subject_name":"Border security and unlawful immigration"},{"subject_id":13444,"subject_name":"Detention of persons"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13311,"subject_name":"Immigrant health and welfare"},{"subject_id":13403,"subject_name":"Immigration status and procedures"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2032874,"date":"2019-06-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1470\/id\/2032874","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1470\/BILLS-116s1470is.pdf","text_size":126986,"text_hash":"fe2108eca9a37b66b4a46ebcea579916"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
