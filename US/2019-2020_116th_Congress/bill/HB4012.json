Specifically, the bill requires ED to provide notice to the VA when it places an institution on heightened cash monitoring status due to a determination that the institution does not meet specific standards for the administration of a program of student financial aid. Further, the bill requires the VA to conduct an analysis of the risk posed by such an institution to students who use educational assistance provided by the VA. The VA must then notify any individual pursuing a course or program of education at the institution and also publish such notice on online.","pending_committee_id":2598,"committee":{"committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},{"date":"2019-08-22","committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
