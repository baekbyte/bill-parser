The President shall direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN to vote for and promote policies to (1) oppose malign influence operations and UN employees involved in such operations, and (2) support Taiwan's membership or meaningful participation in UN entities. (China considers Taiwan a Chinese province and opposes Taiwan's UN participation.) The Department of State shall designate a senior level official to assist in implementing such policies and fulfill other related responsibilities. The State Department shall also establish an Office of American Citizens within the Bureau of International Organization Affairs to promote the candidacy of U.S. citizens for roles in international organizations, including the UN, and to coordinate support for non-U.S. candidates when appropriate. The State Department shall increase by at least 50% the number of U.S.-sponsored Junior Professional Officer positions in the UN. The President shall periodically review evidence and determine if any countries have engaged in malign influence operations that have threatened U.S. interests. The President must designate any such country as a malign global actor and provide an explanation to Congress for why the designation was made.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-04","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9192,"person_hash":"77p1skl0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael McCaul","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McCaul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-10","ftm_eid":15456789,"votesmart_id":49210,"opensecrets_id":"N00026460","knowwho_pid":226551,"ballotpedia":"Michael_McCaul","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14925,"person_hash":"r2dpo5e5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Yoho","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yoho","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-3","ftm_eid":17657842,"votesmart_id":137622,"opensecrets_id":"N00033220","knowwho_pid":378855,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Yoho","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20063,"person_hash":"xgdgyjvl","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Gonzalez","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gonzalez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-16","ftm_eid":44044985,"votesmart_id":178867,"opensecrets_id":"N00041690","knowwho_pid":634993,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Gonzalez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15051,"person_hash":"hme4jiwz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Garland Barr","first_name":"Garland","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barr","suffix":"","nickname":"Andy","district":"HD-KY-6","ftm_eid":9192076,"votesmart_id":117290,"opensecrets_id":"N00031233","knowwho_pid":284674,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Barr","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13161,"subject_name":"Department of State"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13456,"subject_name":"Foreign aid and international relief"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13858,"subject_name":"Taiwan"},{"subject_id":13450,"subject_name":"United Nations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2206317,"date":"2020-08-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7939\/id\/2206317","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7939\/BILLS-116hr7939ih.pdf","text_size":321664,"text_hash":"3a36f018ad24edf76968a0778fe35fee"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
