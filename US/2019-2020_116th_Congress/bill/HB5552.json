The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) must regulate such incidental taking, including by (1) issuing general permits for certain industries, (2) creating a mitigation fee for any incidental taking of migratory birds, and (3) identifying categories of de minimis risk activities that are exempt from liability for the taking of migratory birds. In addition, the FWS must establish and maintain a research program: (1) to evaluate the impacts of commercial activities on birds, (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of best management practices and technologies to avoid or minimize such impacts, and (3) to develop new or improved best management practices and technologies.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-08","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Hearings Held by the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Prior to Introduction.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-15","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-15","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 20 - 14.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-01","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources.
