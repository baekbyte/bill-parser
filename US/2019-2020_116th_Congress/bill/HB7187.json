Specifically, the bill permanently allows FQHCs and RHCs to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner) for telehealth services and excludes such services from certain geographic restrictions. Payment must be made in the same manner as for non-telehealth services, rather than in accordance with a separate methodology determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-11","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-11","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9329,"person_hash":"7f809e7t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Glenn Thompson","first_name":"Glenn","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-5","ftm_eid":4811486,"votesmart_id":24046,"opensecrets_id":"N00029736","knowwho_pid":267269,"ballotpedia":"Glenn_Thompson_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
