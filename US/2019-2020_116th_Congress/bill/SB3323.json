Specifically, a member may be expelled for cause pursuant to a policy adopted by a majority vote of a quorum of the directors of a credit union. Currently, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the credit union membership present at a special meeting. The expelled member may request reinstatement by the credit union board. Member conduct that may be cause for expulsion includes a loss to the credit union, a violation of the credit union membership agreement, a disruption to the operations of a credit union, fraud or attempted fraud, and other illegal or inappropriate behavior.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-24","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-24","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16522,"person_hash":"tukwndaw","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ben Sasse","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sasse","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NE","ftm_eid":23353806,"votesmart_id":150182,"opensecrets_id":"N00035544","knowwho_pid":229398,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Sasse","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18485,"person_hash":"no060koh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Catherine Cortez Masto","first_name":"Catherine","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cortez Masto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NV","ftm_eid":13010255,"votesmart_id":69579,"opensecrets_id":"N00037161","knowwho_pid":252293,"ballotpedia":"Catherine_Cortez_Masto","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB7963","sast_bill_id":1375555}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2152421,"date":"2020-02-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3323\/id\/2152421","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3323\/BILLS-116s3323is.pdf","text_size":318948,"text_hash":"27eb589d11b2dc605ce3342f73bf23bb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
