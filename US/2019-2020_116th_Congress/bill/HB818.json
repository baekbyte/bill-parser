Reprocessing of medical devices is the process to clean and sterilize or disinfect devices for reuse. Specifically, medical device manufacturers must notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1) before making changes to the design or reprocessing instructions of a device, and (2) no more than five days after widely disseminating to health care providers in a foreign country communications regarding changes to the design or reprocessing instructions of a device or regarding a safety concern about a device. A device may not be sold if the manufacturer violates these notification requirements. Rapid assessment tests intended to ensure the proper reprocessing of reusable medical devices are defined as medical devices. The FDA must publish a list of the types of rapid assessment tests for which premarket notification must include validated instructions for use and validation data.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-28","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-29","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16500,"person_hash":"84vk12iq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Lieu","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lieu","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-33","ftm_eid":2451821,"votesmart_id":1516,"opensecrets_id":"N00035825","knowwho_pid":240581,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Lieu","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9234,"person_hash":"modo7s3i","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Judy Chu","first_name":"Judy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chu","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-27","ftm_eid":1258090,"votesmart_id":16539,"opensecrets_id":"N00030600","knowwho_pid":209456,"ballotpedia":"Judy_Chu","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9030,"person_hash":"2bv7ebq4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elijah Cummings","first_name":"Elijah","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Cummings","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-7","ftm_eid":5430817,"votesmart_id":345,"opensecrets_id":"N00001971","knowwho_pid":158891,"ballotpedia":"Elijah_Cummings","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9051,"person_hash":"x4hkzhov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raul Grijalva","first_name":"Raul","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Grijalva","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-3","ftm_eid":17657668,"votesmart_id":28253,"opensecrets_id":"N00025284","knowwho_pid":211719,"ballotpedia":"Raul_Grijalva","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1903635,"date":"2019-02-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB818\/id\/1903635","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr818\/BILLS-116hr818ih.pdf","text_size":282366,"text_hash":"069521d2657de38a1022442fa09dc85f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
