Current law requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 10% of its revenue from sources other than federal student aid. requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 15% of its revenue from sources other than federal funds (i.e., it replaces the so-called 90\/10 rule with an 85\/15 rule). Additionally, the bill limits what a proprietary institution may treat as revenue to the school in calculating whether it derives at least 15% of its revenue from sources other than federal funds. Finally, the bill makes compliance with the 85\/15 rule a condition of institutional eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs (i.e., failure to comply results in immediate loss of institutional eligibility). Currently, a proprietary IHE must violate the rule for two consecutive years before losing eligibility.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-10","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9025,"person_hash":"0flzaozy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Cohen","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cohen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-9","ftm_eid":6442808,"votesmart_id":24340,"opensecrets_id":"N00003225","knowwho_pid":198993,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Hobbs,_Missouri_Representative","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9068,"person_hash":"ludkkyov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sheila Jackson-Lee","first_name":"Sheila","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jackson-Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-18","ftm_eid":6716263,"votesmart_id":21692,"opensecrets_id":"N00005818","knowwho_pid":159088,"ballotpedia":"Sheila_Jackson_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20052,"person_hash":"lmg91h6p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gil Cisneros","first_name":"Gil","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cisneros","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-39","ftm_eid":17779260,"votesmart_id":179370,"opensecrets_id":"N00041464","knowwho_pid":631203,"ballotpedia":"Gil_Cisneros","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8979,"person_hash":"s3k15nh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben Lujan","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"Ray","last_name":"Lujan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-3","ftm_eid":9025644,"votesmart_id":102842,"opensecrets_id":"N00029562","knowwho_pid":266495,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Lujan,_Sr.","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20094,"person_hash":"8q0j3im4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ayanna Pressley","first_name":"Ayanna","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Pressley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-7","ftm_eid":45365104,"votesmart_id":122700,"opensecrets_id":"N00042581","knowwho_pid":234321,"ballotpedia":"Ayanna_Pressley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9078,"person_hash":"7ingxztp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barbara Lee","first_name":"Barbara","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-13","ftm_eid":1263932,"votesmart_id":8315,"opensecrets_id":"N00008046","knowwho_pid":158726,"ballotpedia":"Barbara_Lee_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1775","sast_bill_id":1267959},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB3369","sast_bill_id":1269521}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13382,"subject_name":"Veterans' loans, housing, homeless programs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2040459,"date":"2019-06-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3179\/id\/2040459","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3179\/BILLS-116hr3179ih.pdf","text_size":253386,"text_hash":"2ecdb744bbc2105e4489934690f9c5a1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
