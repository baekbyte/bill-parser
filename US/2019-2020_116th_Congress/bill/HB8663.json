The bill's provisions shall apply to an entity that (1) is organized under the laws of China and has its principal place of business there, unless the entity is a Chinese subsidy or affiliate of a non-Chinese entity; or (2) has been designated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as being subject to the Chinese Communist Party's extrajudicial direction. Generally, under current law, an agent of a foreign principal engaging in lobbying in the United States must periodically file disclosures with DOJ, with specified exemptions. Under the bill, an existing exemption for a foreign agent that engages only in private and nonpolitical activities to further trade and commerce shall not apply to an agent operating on behalf of such a Chinese entity. Similarly, another existing exemption for an agent that has already registered as a lobbyist shall not apply to an agent working for such a Chinese entity.","pending_committee_id":2309,"committee":{"committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-23","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-23","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-23","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18306,"person_hash":"h18j43v2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Gallagher","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gallagher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-8","ftm_eid":40609598,"votesmart_id":171843,"opensecrets_id":"N00039330","knowwho_pid":577549,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Gallagher_(New_York)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4843","sast_bill_id":1381116}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13405,"subject_name":"Asia"},{"subject_id":13732,"subject_name":"China"},{"subject_id":13365,"subject_name":"Foreign and international corporations"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13592,"subject_name":"Political parties and affiliation"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2215868,"date":"2020-11-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8663\/id\/2215868","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8663\/BILLS-116hr8663ih.pdf","text_size":294291,"text_hash":"d12f8278733e76c662505a8a50d9bd6b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
