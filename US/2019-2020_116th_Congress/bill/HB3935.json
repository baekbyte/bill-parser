The bill also requires states, as a condition of federal payment for such transportation services, to comply with certain utilization management requirements. States must also establish mechanisms that ensure transportation providers and drivers meet specified quality and safety standards. The Government Accountability Office must report on the extent of, and identify measures that prevent, Medicaid fraud and abuse in relation to such services. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must, among other things, establish a stakeholder working group to address certain challenges regarding Medicaid program integrity and coverage of such services.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-24","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2020-09-22","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-08","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-11","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-15","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-15","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-17","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
