Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish grant programs for advancing the integration and optimization of distributed energy resources (e.g., smaller power sources that can be aggregated to provide power, such as rooftop solar panels) into the electric energy grid; demonstrating the use of household hot water heaters as energy storage resources; advancing electric vehicle technologies; and supporting the voluntary deployment of granular electricity pricing that is based upon the electricity's value at the time and location of the production or consumption of the electricity. In addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2025 and revises the DOE grant program for smart grid investments.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13179,"subject_name":"Energy assistance for the poor and aged"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13795,"subject_name":"Energy prices"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13519,"subject_name":"Hybrid, electric, and advanced technology vehicles"},{"subject_id":321502,"subject_name":"Lighting, heating, cooling"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2038146,"date":"2019-06-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1742\/id\/2038146","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1742\/BILLS-116s1742is.pdf","text_size":300413,"text_hash":"f30a6df8008909ae76aa1d53e2b96e53"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
