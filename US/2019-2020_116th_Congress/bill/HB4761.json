The CBP must also test new chemical screening devices at various purity levels before it commits to their acquisition. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must implement a plan for the long-term development of a centralized spectral database for chemical screening devices.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-18","committee_id":2306,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Homeland Security"},{"date":"2019-12-10","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Trade.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Ordered to be Reported.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-03","action":"Reported by the Committee on Homeland Security.
