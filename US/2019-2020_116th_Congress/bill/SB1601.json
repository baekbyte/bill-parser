The alert must (1) include a distinct auditory and visual alert which may be combined with a haptic alert (i.e., vibrations), and (2) be activated when the vehicle engine is turned off. DOT must enter into an agreement with an independent third party for a study on retrofitting existing passenger motor vehicles with technology to address the problem of children left in rear seats after the vehicle engine is turned off.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-10","action":"Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
