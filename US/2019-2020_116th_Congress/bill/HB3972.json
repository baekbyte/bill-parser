Specifically, the bill establishes a congressional approval process for a major rule. A major rule may only take effect if Congress approves of the rule. A major rule is a rule that results in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. In addition, the bill establishes a congressional disapproval process for a nonmajor rule. A nonmajor rule may only take effect if Congress does not disapprove of the rule.","pending_committee_id":4044,"committee":{"committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-08-15","committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Rules, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-15","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9232,"person_hash":"aiyghgq9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Sensenbrenner","first_name":"F.
