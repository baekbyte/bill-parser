The bill exempts employers from state income tax withholding and information reporting requirements for employees not subject to income tax in the state under this bill. For the purposes of determining penalties related to an employer's state income tax withholding or reporting requirements, an employer may rely on an employee's annual determination of the time expected to be spent working in a state in the absence of fraud or collusion by such employee. For the purposes of this bill, the term \"employee\" excludes professional athletes; professional entertainers; production employees who perform services in connection with certain film, television, or other commercial video productions; and public figures who are persons of prominence who perform services for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.","pending_committee_id":4044,"committee":{"committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-22","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-11-15","committee_id":4044,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-22","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-15","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20110,"person_hash":"a7fpcibx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Greg Steube","first_name":"Greg","middle_name":"","last_name":"Steube","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-17","ftm_eid":6692870,"votesmart_id":117248,"opensecrets_id":"N00042808","knowwho_pid":289471,"ballotpedia":"Greg_Steube","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB604","sast_bill_id":1227261},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5674","sast_bill_id":1320030},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4318","sast_bill_id":1374557}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2059245,"date":"2019-10-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4796\/id\/2059245","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4796\/BILLS-116hr4796ih.pdf","text_size":336730,"text_hash":"b815682e403d87451d274122e949eb7f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
