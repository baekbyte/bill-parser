The loans must have the same terms and conditions and benefits to borrowers as federal direct Stafford Loans. Interest on these loans may only accrue during periods when a borrower is not earning taxable income due to professional negligence, professional incompetence, or malicious action on the part of the borrower. The Department of Education (ED) must carry out a repayment plan program for the interest-free loans under which loans payments are automatically withheld from the pre-tax income of the borrower. ED must cancel any outstanding balance of principal or interest due on those interest-free loans made to a borrower who has made 300 monthly payments. The borrower must be taxed on the amount canceled. Those taxes must be applied to carry out the federal direct loan program.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-18","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11807,"person_hash":"0cn18vb4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Cicilline","first_name":"David","middle_name":"N.","last_name":"Cicilline","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-RI-1","ftm_eid":6441236,"votesmart_id":7349,"opensecrets_id":"N00032019","knowwho_pid":198593,"ballotpedia":"David_Cicilline","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8988,"person_hash":"2vo8uaxr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Janice Schakowsky","first_name":"Janice","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Schakowsky","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-9","ftm_eid":6419995,"votesmart_id":6387,"opensecrets_id":"N00004724","knowwho_pid":158836,"ballotpedia":"Jan_Schakowsky","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9128,"person_hash":"ypyg7okp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jose Serrano","first_name":"Jose","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Serrano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-15","ftm_eid":17391438,"votesmart_id":26981,"opensecrets_id":"N00001813","knowwho_pid":158985,"ballotpedia":"Jose_Serrano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9068,"person_hash":"ludkkyov","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sheila Jackson-Lee","first_name":"Sheila","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jackson-Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-18","ftm_eid":6716263,"votesmart_id":21692,"opensecrets_id":"N00005818","knowwho_pid":159088,"ballotpedia":"Sheila_Jackson_Lee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2058628,"date":"2019-10-27","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4747\/id\/2058628","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4747\/BILLS-116hr4747ih.pdf","text_size":335960,"text_hash":"b56a9e7363ee603b18b60433228dd0d6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
