A CHIMP is a provision that (1) would have been estimated as affecting direct spending or receipts if the provision were included in legislation other than an appropriations bill; and (2) results in a net decrease in budget authority in the current year or the budget year, but does not result in a net decrease in outlays over the period of the total of the current year, the budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently adopted budget resolution.","pending_committee_id":2322,"committee":{"committee_id":2322,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Budget"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-26","committee_id":2322,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Budget"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-26","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Budget.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11905,"person_hash":"j65ej594","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Pat Toomey","first_name":"Pat","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toomey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":4944091,"votesmart_id":24096,"opensecrets_id":"N00001489","knowwho_pid":159045,"ballotpedia":"Pat_Toomey","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9445,"person_hash":"f2k79x2t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Crapo","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crapo","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":19890076,"votesmart_id":26830,"opensecrets_id":"N00006267","knowwho_pid":165218,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Crapo","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11061,"person_hash":"r3ltpj5e","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Lankford","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lankford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OK-5","ftm_eid":17657561,"votesmart_id":124938,"opensecrets_id":"N00031129","knowwho_pid":284972,"ballotpedia":"James_Lankford","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9496,"person_hash":"gcopvn6m","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Risch","first_name":"James","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Risch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ID","ftm_eid":6576171,"votesmart_id":2919,"opensecrets_id":"N00029441","knowwho_pid":213702,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Risch","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13124,"subject_name":"Economics and public finance"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13138,"subject_name":"Budget process"},{"subject_id":13406,"subject_name":"Crime victims"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2214632,"date":"2020-11-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4879\/id\/2214632","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4879\/BILLS-116s4879is.pdf","text_size":299848,"text_hash":"8fd62a71c076aeee8bbb88b4ba41534e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
