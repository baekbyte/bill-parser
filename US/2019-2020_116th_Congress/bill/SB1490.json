Specifically, the bill allows the Department of Education to provide funding to an institution of postsecondary education that releases a student's records of postsecondary coursework and credits without the consent of the student or the student's parents if the student provides written consent prior to receiving the credential.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-15","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9450,"person_hash":"i6e8frel","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Johnny Isakson","first_name":"Johnny","middle_name":"","last_name":"Isakson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":7238922,"votesmart_id":1721,"opensecrets_id":"N00002593","knowwho_pid":158812,"ballotpedia":"Johnny_Isakson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20294,"person_hash":"1lllgwva","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Braun","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Braun","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IN","ftm_eid":21084493,"votesmart_id":148564,"opensecrets_id":"N00041731","knowwho_pid":484213,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Braun","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":21467,"person_hash":"b5vz9rek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kelly Loeffler","first_name":"Kelly","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loeffler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":6803079,"votesmart_id":188718,"opensecrets_id":"N00046125","knowwho_pid":724457,"ballotpedia":"Kelly_Loeffler","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2768","sast_bill_id":1261579},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4674","sast_bill_id":1276853}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":81062,"subject_name":"Student records"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2032647,"date":"2019-06-03","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1490\/id\/2032647","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1490\/BILLS-116s1490is.pdf","text_size":122579,"text_hash":"a7d3bdaca9e775c8ac25219e972a2599"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
