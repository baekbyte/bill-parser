The bill requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in consultation with other federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to prescribe regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of carbon oxide so that it does not escape into the atmosphere. The IRS regulations must consider the carbon oxide to be disposed of in secure geological storage if it is stored in compliance with specified rules promulgated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act for the geologic sequestration of carbon oxide. The bill also revises the definition of \"qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project\" to exclude a requirement for the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter to commence after December 31, 1990.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11971,"person_hash":"iwcgtwmm","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Hoeven","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hoeven","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":144736,"votesmart_id":41788,"opensecrets_id":"N00031688","knowwho_pid":209683,"ballotpedia":"John_Hoeven","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14889,"person_hash":"tc69v8nn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Steve Daines","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Daines","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MT","ftm_eid":7687176,"votesmart_id":135720,"opensecrets_id":"N00033054","knowwho_pid":378524,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Daines","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19622,"person_hash":"0ya4l9wg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cindy Hyde-Smith","first_name":"Cindy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hyde-Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MS","ftm_eid":6408036,"votesmart_id":20784,"opensecrets_id":"N00043298","knowwho_pid":196212,"ballotpedia":"Cindy_Hyde-Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9493,"person_hash":"cabmgf99","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Roger Wicker","first_name":"Roger","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Wicker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MS","ftm_eid":17659028,"votesmart_id":21926,"opensecrets_id":"N00003280","knowwho_pid":158928,"ballotpedia":"Roger_Wicker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13368,"subject_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047766,"date":"2019-07-31","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2263\/id\/2047766","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2263\/BILLS-116s2263is.pdf","text_size":363999,"text_hash":"8b0bb550c32220ddc37c6874a396224b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
