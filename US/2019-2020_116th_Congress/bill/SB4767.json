Generally, the bill requires the CDC to continue the activities of the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This laboratory operates within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and conducts scientific research, develops guidance, and disseminates information concerning workplace health hazards. The bill also specifically directs the CDC, in consultation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Food and Drug Administration, to establish a program in the laboratory to research personal protective equipment used in health care settings. In carrying out this program, the CDC must consult with health care personnel to inform research, conduct pilot tests of new equipment, and coordinate with manufacturers concerning the production of, and supply chain for, such equipment. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to periodically conduct public workshops focused on research, development, and other issues concerning personal protective equipment.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-30","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9415,"person_hash":"m7c3vp1o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Debbie Stabenow","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stabenow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MI","ftm_eid":10688869,"votesmart_id":515,"opensecrets_id":"N00004118","knowwho_pid":205511,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Stabenow","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213438,"date":"2020-10-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4767\/id\/2213438","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4767\/BILLS-116s4767is.pdf","text_size":298744,"text_hash":"a86a5f91320ecb788eefcb6bfbcde246"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
