A makerspace is a facility (which may be at a fixed location or a mobile unit) that is open to the public and provides individuals with access to (1) tools, technology, and educational resources designed to enable such individuals to create physical goods, including prototypes; and (2) educational opportunities, including vocational training and assistance with early-stage business ventures. A partnership must contribute, for the activities for which the grant was awarded, nonfederal matching funds in an amount determined appropriate by the institute. Each eligible partnership that receives a grant may not use its grant funds, or the matching funds contributed by it, for construction activities at a public library that would provide extra square footage to house a makerspace.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8979,"person_hash":"s3k15nh3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ben Lujan","first_name":"Ben","middle_name":"Ray","last_name":"Lujan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-3","ftm_eid":9025644,"votesmart_id":102842,"opensecrets_id":"N00029562","knowwho_pid":266495,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Lujan,_Sr.","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15239,"person_hash":"2abxxyrw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Takano","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Takano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-41","ftm_eid":17657771,"votesmart_id":22337,"opensecrets_id":"N00006701","knowwho_pid":378804,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Takano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13624,"subject_name":"Arts, culture, religion"},{"subject_id":22782,"subject_name":"Business education"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13222,"subject_name":"Humanities programs funding"},{"subject_id":13389,"subject_name":"Libraries and archives"},{"subject_id":13560,"subject_name":"Museums, exhibitions, cultural centers"},{"subject_id":13727,"subject_name":"Product development and innovation"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":81057,"subject_name":"Vocational and technical education"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2153655,"date":"2020-02-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5967\/id\/2153655","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5967\/BILLS-116hr5967ih.pdf","text_size":324151,"text_hash":"b3053f3d8e914089666784e3ce99f026"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
