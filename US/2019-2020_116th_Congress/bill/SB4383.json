Commerce must issue regulations to establish criteria for whether a project directly or indirectly increases the accessibility of affordable, quality child care. Such criteria shall consider (1) the availability, validity, and accessibility of timely data, (2) the extent to which a project contributes to a family's financial security, and (3) the extent to which a project addresses child care needs in child care deserts or areas otherwise recognized as experiencing a shortage. A child care desert is an area in which the number of children who are under age five is more than three times the number of slots provided by child care providers who are licensed or registered by the state involved, or a community that the state or tribal entity involved determines has a low supply of quality, affordable child care. Commerce must also issue guidance on how to include the accessibility of affordable, quality child care in a comprehensive economic development strategy.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-30","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16519,"person_hash":"39r6j2zz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joni Ernst","first_name":"Joni","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ernst","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IA","ftm_eid":6151700,"votesmart_id":128583,"opensecrets_id":"N00035483","knowwho_pid":328986,"ballotpedia":"Joni_Ernst","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7683","sast_bill_id":1373736},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8326","sast_bill_id":1378556}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13668,"subject_name":"Child care and development"},{"subject_id":13152,"subject_name":"Department of Commerce"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205720,"date":"2020-08-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4383\/id\/2205720","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4383\/BILLS-116s4383is.pdf","text_size":304866,"text_hash":"c0b58c68e9e934a0cfcf70c5ae291d13"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
