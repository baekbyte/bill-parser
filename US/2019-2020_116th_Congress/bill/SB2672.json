The bill designates a state for the new location of each department. The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration must, for each agency, develop a proposal to relocate the agency to an area that has experienced economic distress. Relocation proposals must include three proposed locations in one state. Locations may not be within 30 miles of a city that has a population of more than 800,000. States may select a location for a relocating agency from the proposed locations. The bill requires relocations to take place within 10 years of the selection of a location and provides penalties for failure to relocate. Federal courts are denied jurisdiction over a case or controversy in which a party challenges a selection or action taken under this bill.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-23","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13152,"subject_name":"Department of Commerce"},{"subject_id":13154,"subject_name":"Department of Education"},{"subject_id":13155,"subject_name":"Department of Energy"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":13158,"subject_name":"Department of Housing and Urban Development"},{"subject_id":13160,"subject_name":"Department of Labor"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13163,"subject_name":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13598,"subject_name":"Indiana"},{"subject_id":13550,"subject_name":"Kentucky"},{"subject_id":323150,"subject_name":"Labor market"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13557,"subject_name":"Michigan"},{"subject_id":13558,"subject_name":"Missouri"},{"subject_id":13563,"subject_name":"New Mexico"},{"subject_id":13566,"subject_name":"Ohio"},{"subject_id":13601,"subject_name":"Pennsylvania"},{"subject_id":13572,"subject_name":"South Carolina"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13320,"subject_name":"Tennessee"},{"subject_id":13293,"subject_name":"Unemployment"},{"subject_id":13579,"subject_name":"West Virginia"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2059264,"date":"2019-10-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2672\/id\/2059264","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2672\/BILLS-116s2672is.pdf","text_size":348346,"text_hash":"8c1c8fe49cddc50d1d2c4dacde092401"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
