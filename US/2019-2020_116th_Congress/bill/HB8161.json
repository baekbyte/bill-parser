The centers must provide comprehensive services tailored to meet the needs of individuals returning to a particular community. These services may include, for example, help with finding employment and applying for public benefits. Additionally, DOJ must evaluate this program. DOJ may also award grants to states and localities for toll-free hotlines that direct callers to local reentry services. DOJ must also develop best practices for setting up these hotlines.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-04","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2020-12-09","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-04","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-15","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Judiciary.
