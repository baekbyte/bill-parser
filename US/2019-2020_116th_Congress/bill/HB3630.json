First, the bill requires insurers offering plans that cover emergency services to bill plan holders no more than the median in-network rate for a particular emergency service, even if the service provider is out of network. The bill further prohibits insurers from billing plan holders more than the median in-network rate for nonemergency services provided by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities.Out-of-network providers may not bill plan holders for the difference between the in-network and out-of-network rates for emergency services. The bill further prohibits out-of-network providers from billing plan holders for the difference in rates for nonemergency services provided at an in-network facility unless the provider complies with specified notice and consent requirements. Even when complying with these requirements, an out-of-network provider may not charge plan holders for the difference in rates for such nonemergency services if the provider is based at the in-network facility and is the only provider available to deliver the particular treatment or service at the facility.The Department of Health and Human Services must provide grants to states to establish or maintain All Payer Claims Databases, which publish claims and payment information from insurers.The bill also requires insurers to publish provider directories and requires the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Labor to report on certain issues related to the commercial health care market.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
