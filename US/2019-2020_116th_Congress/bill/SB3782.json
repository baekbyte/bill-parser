Under current law, the authorization for the Paycheck Protection Program and the SBA's standard small business loan products (the 7(a) loan program) are combined into one joint authorization for the duration of the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill returns the 7(a) loan program to the purview of its stand-alone authorization to prevent it from being terminated upon the two programs' attainment of the joint authorization cap.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-20","action":"Introduced in the Senate, read twice, considered, read the third time, and passed without amendment by Unanimous Consent.
