The amendments made by this bill are retroactively effective as if included in the Indian Reorganization Act. This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Department of the Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted.","pending_committee_id":2335,"committee":{"committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-09","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-02-05","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},{"date":"2019-05-16","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-05","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 29 - 7.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Mr. Grijalva moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
