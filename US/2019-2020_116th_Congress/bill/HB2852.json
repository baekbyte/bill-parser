The bill also provides specified educational requirements for appraisers for mortgages for single-family housing.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-20","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},{"date":"2019-09-11","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-20","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-11","action":"Ordered to be Reported Without Recommendation (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-10","action":"Mr. San Nicolas moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-10","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
