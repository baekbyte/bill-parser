Specifically, the bill allows individuals aged 50 to 64 to enroll in Medicare if such individuals would otherwise qualify for Medicare at the age of 65. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must determine enrollment periods and set premiums for the buy-in option established under the bill, in accordance with specified requirements. The CMS must also award grants to states and nonprofit organizations for outreach and enrollment activities relating to the buy-in option. The bill also (1) establishes a supplemental option under Medicare to cover cost-sharing for beneficiaries; (2) repeals provisions that prohibit the CMS from negotiating the prices of prescription drugs; and (3) establishes an individual market reinsurance program relating to coverage of high-cost individuals, as specified.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
