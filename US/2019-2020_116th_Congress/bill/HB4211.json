The bill also authorizes citizen suits to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. Dealers and exhibitors must apply to USDA for licenses or renewal licenses each year. Before issuing or renewing licenses, USDA must conduct unannounced facility inspections. USDA must deny an application for a new license if the applicant fails to meet animal welfare standards during a second inspection, a renewal license if the applicant violates such standards in more than one inspection in the previous two years, or a new or renewal license if the dealer or exhibitor has violated laws relating to animals or if the issuance of the license would facilitate the circumvention of state or local laws that prohibit the private ownership of certain animals. Further, USDA must suspend the licenses of dealers or exhibitors whose violations present a risk to animal welfare. USDA must revoke the licenses if the violations persist or if the licensees commit multiple violations. Dealers and exhibitors with suspended or revoked licenses may not be (1) granted another license, (2) granted another license through another person or entity, or (3) employed by another licensee to work with animals during the period of the suspension or revocation.","pending_committee_id":3354,"committee":{"committee_id":3354,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-27","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2019-09-04","committee_id":3354,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-08-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18316,"person_hash":"kvbno8r6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raja Krishnamoorthi","first_name":"Raja","middle_name":"","last_name":"Krishnamoorthi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-8","ftm_eid":6265333,"votesmart_id":117519,"opensecrets_id":"N00033240","knowwho_pid":385662,"ballotpedia":"Raja_Krishnamoorthi","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16477,"person_hash":"zuh8egxj","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elise Stefanik","first_name":"Elise","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stefanik","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-21","ftm_eid":21236694,"votesmart_id":152539,"opensecrets_id":"N00035523","knowwho_pid":247560,"ballotpedia":"Elise_Stefanik","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15217,"person_hash":"ti9w2cwq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tony Cardenas","first_name":"Tony","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cardenas","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-29","ftm_eid":17657742,"votesmart_id":9754,"opensecrets_id":"N00033373","knowwho_pid":193068,"ballotpedia":"Tony_C%C3%A1rdenas","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8988,"person_hash":"2vo8uaxr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Janice Schakowsky","first_name":"Janice","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Schakowsky","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-9","ftm_eid":6419995,"votesmart_id":6387,"opensecrets_id":"N00004724","knowwho_pid":158836,"ballotpedia":"Jan_Schakowsky","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9118,"person_hash":"6pt9at2x","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"C.A.
