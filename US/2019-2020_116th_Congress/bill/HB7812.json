Expensing is the treatment of expenditures as operating costs deductible in full in the current taxable year. The bill allows a new tax deduction for 200% of the cost of purchasing or acquiring such critical minerals and metals extracted from deposits in the United States. The bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a pilot project grant program for the development of critical minerals and metals in the United States. A grant awarded under such program may not exceed $10 million. In awarding grants, DOD must give priority to projects determined to be economically viable over the long term and must allot 30% of grants funds to the secondary recovery of critical minerals and metals.","pending_committee_id":4286,"committee":{"committee_id":4286,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-29","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20076,"person_hash":"yfzzetnh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Joyce","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Joyce","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-13","ftm_eid":44955073,"votesmart_id":178911,"opensecrets_id":"N00043242","knowwho_pid":659206,"ballotpedia":"John_Joyce_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3694","sast_bill_id":1365600},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4537","sast_bill_id":1377505},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8143","sast_bill_id":1377255}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13140,"subject_name":"Buy American requirements"},{"subject_id":13150,"subject_name":"Defense spending"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":20684,"subject_name":"Materials"},{"subject_id":13785,"subject_name":"Metals"},{"subject_id":13485,"subject_name":"Military procurement, research, weapons development"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13945,"subject_name":"Strategic materials and reserves"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205792,"date":"2020-08-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7812\/id\/2205792","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7812\/BILLS-116hr7812ih.pdf","text_size":309895,"text_hash":"a193789e303abb91e0ccfd82c51e0490"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
