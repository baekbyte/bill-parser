The Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council shall provide Congress with a plan to reduce the background investigation backlog and to consolidate security clearance processes to improve efficiency. The Director of National Intelligence, or another individual selected by the President, shall serve as the Security Executive Agent for all U.S. departments and agencies. The agent shall establish a policy and implementation plan for improving security clearance procedures. The agent shall report to Congress on (1) ways to improve or simplify investigation procedures; (2) the feasibility of the clearance in person concept, which permits an individual to maintain access to classified information for up to three years after leaving a cleared position; and (3) protections for the confidentiality of whistleblower-related communications in continuous vetting programs. Federal departments and agencies shall report annually to the agent certain information related to reciprocal recognition of security clearances when an individual moves between positions within the department or agency, and the agent shall summarize and report such information to Congress. The bill imposes various targets for reducing the pendency of secret and top secret level clearance determinations. It also requires reports to Congress on various topics, such as the feasibility of having no more than three tiers of trust and security clearance positions.","pending_committee_id":2565,"committee":{"committee_id":2565,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Select Intelligence"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-31","committee_id":2565,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Select Intelligence"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-31","action":"Read twice and referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB245","sast_bill_id":1177730},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1589","sast_bill_id":1264050}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13177,"subject_name":"Employment discrimination and employee rights"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13888,"subject_name":"Personnel records"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1908377,"date":"2019-02-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB314\/id\/1908377","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s314\/BILLS-116s314is.pdf","text_size":324203,"text_hash":"44bcb7a2cd9446ba7d554d61e51d918c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
