Specifically, securities offerings are exempt from these registration requirements if (1) the aggregate amount of securities sold to all investors by the issuer is not more than $250,000, (2) the amount sold to any investor by the issuer does not exceed $5,000, and (3) the transaction is conducted through a registered broker or funding portal. This exemption ends three years after the date of enactment. The SEC may by rule prohibit a person from engaging in such an offering if the person is subject to certain bad-actor or statutory disqualifications. The Government Accountability Office must report on the impact of this exemption.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9372,"person_hash":"9q3ib5o9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Patrick McHenry","first_name":"Patrick","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McHenry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-10","ftm_eid":6009425,"votesmart_id":21031,"opensecrets_id":"N00026627","knowwho_pid":212009,"ballotpedia":"Patrick_McHenry","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15243,"person_hash":"5gbai9gz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ann Wagner","first_name":"Ann","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wagner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MO-2","ftm_eid":4493676,"votesmart_id":136083,"opensecrets_id":"N00033106","knowwho_pid":378827,"ballotpedia":"Ann_Wagner","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15051,"person_hash":"hme4jiwz","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Garland Barr","first_name":"Garland","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barr","suffix":"","nickname":"Andy","district":"HD-KY-6","ftm_eid":9192076,"votesmart_id":117290,"opensecrets_id":"N00031233","knowwho_pid":284674,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Barr","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11143,"person_hash":"u6jyo8ie","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Stivers","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stivers","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-15","ftm_eid":3672534,"votesmart_id":45333,"opensecrets_id":"N00029574","knowwho_pid":213916,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Stivers","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11058,"person_hash":"aw6szgk2","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Huizenga","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Huizenga","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-2","ftm_eid":6574786,"votesmart_id":38351,"opensecrets_id":"N00030673","knowwho_pid":288017,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Huizenga","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13384,"subject_name":"Administrative remedies"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13666,"subject_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2176681,"date":"2020-04-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6252\/id\/2176681","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6252\/BILLS-116hr6252ih.pdf","text_size":314925,"text_hash":"45e8a492748a84cdf1bfb8fd49f58e7c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
