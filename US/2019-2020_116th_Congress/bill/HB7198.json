Specifically, the program must (1) provide scholarships to students who are enrolled in programs of study related to national security at historically Black colleges and universities or at institutions of higher education with at least 50% of total student enrollment from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in the fields of science and engineering, (2) provide scholarship recipients with internship opportunities or other temporary appointments in the federal national security workforce, and (3) prioritize the employment placement of scholarship recipients in the federal government. Additionally, the post-award employment obligations of a scholarship recipient must include three years of work in a position related to national security at a federal, state, local, or tribal agency. A scholarship recipient may fulfill this condition by serving in the Armed Forces. Finally, a scholarship recipient who completes less than the required three years of service must repay the scholarship, or the scholarship must be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan that is subject to repayment.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-15","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-15","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18293,"person_hash":"vidnqcls","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Anthony Brown","first_name":"Anthony","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-4","ftm_eid":5017996,"votesmart_id":19344,"opensecrets_id":"N00036999","knowwho_pid":195317,"ballotpedia":"Anthony_Brown_(Maryland)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9333,"person_hash":"ftinbgg3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Turner","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Turner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-10","ftm_eid":17658265,"votesmart_id":45519,"opensecrets_id":"N00025175","knowwho_pid":211690,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Turner_(Ohio)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16496,"person_hash":"giwqb3ky","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Pete Aguilar","first_name":"Pete","middle_name":"","last_name":"Aguilar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-31","ftm_eid":17657748,"votesmart_id":70114,"opensecrets_id":"N00033997","knowwho_pid":397292,"ballotpedia":"Pete_Aguilar","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB6395","sast_bill_id":1361898},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HR1271","sast_bill_id":1388768}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":20700,"subject_name":"Minority employment"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2201224,"date":"2020-07-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7198\/id\/2201224","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7198\/BILLS-116hr7198ih.pdf","text_size":314708,"text_hash":"f5e44c4aee80055d6c88db8fc33a5245"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
