Specified damage is defined as damage to federal facilities and property; negative impacts on federal operations, including damage to equipment, loss of program support, and any other calculable costs, as well as costs necessary to resume operations; and loss of services, totaling a cost exceeding $500,000, that would have been provided by the agency but for the disaster. The bill provides for expedited consideration of a bill making supplemental appropriations to agencies in response to such report.","pending_committee_id":4010,"committee":{"committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-18","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2019-09-19","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-18","action":"Referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in addition to the Committee on Rules, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-19","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18300,"person_hash":"pzu9xprp","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Neal Dunn","first_name":"Neal","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Dunn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-2","ftm_eid":117671,"votesmart_id":166297,"opensecrets_id":"N00037442","knowwho_pid":547694,"ballotpedia":"Neal_Dunn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13437,"subject_name":"Emergency management"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13472,"subject_name":"Emergency planning and evacuation"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13196,"subject_name":"Government buildings, facilities, and property"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":13588,"subject_name":"Members of Congress"},{"subject_id":13442,"subject_name":"Natural disasters"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2054974,"date":"2019-09-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4376\/id\/2054974","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4376\/BILLS-116hr4376ih.pdf","text_size":363681,"text_hash":"4bdec75ef5f20da7f348269589c86f54"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
