National and state freight plans must include strategies and goals to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution, water runoff, and wildlife habitat loss. The bill imposes a 1% excise tax upon the ground transportation cost of property and requires the deposit of such tax revenues into a Freight Trust Fund to finance the Multimodal Freight Formula Program and the National Freight Competitive Grant Program.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and
