Specifically, the bill requires the President to establish an interagency National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy Joint Implementation Working Group. The working group must adopt the 2013 National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy, which addresses the effects of extreme weather and climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants. After the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences releases a periodic scientific assessment required under the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the working group must use sound science to review and revise the strategy to incorporate new information and advances in the development of strategies to help fish, wildlife, and plants adapt. Each federal agency must integrate the strategy into agency plans, environmental reviews, and programs. The Department of the Interior must establish a National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to assess and develop scientific information, tools, strategies, and techniques to support the working group and other interested parties in addressing the effects of extreme weather and climate change. Interior must establish an Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Sciences to advise the working group.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-15","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-06-03","committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-15","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-09-24","action":"Subcommittee Hearings Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 22 - 15.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-01","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources.
