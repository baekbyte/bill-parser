Specifically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must provide grants to eligible institutions of higher education or research institutions to establish and maintain between three and five centers of excellence for innovative stormwater control infrastructure. Among other things, the centers must research such infrastructure and provide technical assistance to state, tribal, and local governments to assist with stormwater control infrastructure projects. One of the centers must be the national electronic clearinghouse center. That center must operate a website and a public database on the infrastructure. In addition, the EPA must provide grants to state, tribal, or local governments or entities that manage stormwater, drinking water resources, or wastewater resources for innovative stormwater control infrastructure projects.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-10","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-10","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9472,"person_hash":"4c2m8lz3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Udall","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Udall","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NM","ftm_eid":1864753,"votesmart_id":22658,"opensecrets_id":"N00006561","knowwho_pid":158967,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Udall","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4266","sast_bill_id":1274158}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13528,"subject_name":"Environmental technology"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13771,"subject_name":"Hydrology and hydrography"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053158,"date":"2019-09-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2456\/id\/2053158","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2456\/BILLS-116s2456is.pdf","text_size":370849,"text_hash":"b4ad0a56e79a2449d4181fb73b4bc661"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
