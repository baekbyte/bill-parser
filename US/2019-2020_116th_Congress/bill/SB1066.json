Specifically, agencies that administer these programs must direct at least 10% of funding to counties with poverty rates that have equaled or exceeded 20% for at least 30 years. In addition, agencies must allocate, based on a formula, a certain level of funding to census tracts that have sustained poverty rates of 20% or higher for the past five years. This funding model, known as the 10-20-30 proposal, has been applied through appropriations measures to, among other programs, rural development programs administered by the Department of Agriculture.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental
