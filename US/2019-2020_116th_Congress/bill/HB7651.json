If the temperature of a passenger exceeds the guidance for what constitutes a fever issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the time such temperature screening is carried out, the TSA shall not permit such passenger to enter the sterile area. The TSA shall consider a resolution process for identifying medical conditions unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that could result in a temperature that exceeds CDC guidance. The pilot program terminates on the date of the termination of the COVID-19 public health emergency.","pending_committee_id":4016,"committee":{"committee_id":4016,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime
