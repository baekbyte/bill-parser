(The 1619 Project is an initiative that addresses the beginning of slavery in the United States.) Additionally, an elementary or secondary school that teaches this project or an LEA that supports its teaching in public schools is ineligible to receive federal funds for professional development. Further, the Departments of Education, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services must reduce federal funds in a prorated amount to an elementary or secondary school that teaches this project or an LEA that supports its teaching in public schools. However, federal funding shall not be reduced for programs for low-income students (e.g., free or reduced-price lunch) or students with disabilities.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-23","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-23","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14887,"person_hash":"zd3asd1k","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tom Cotton","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cotton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AR-4","ftm_eid":13607871,"votesmart_id":135651,"opensecrets_id":"N00033363","knowwho_pid":378517,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Cotton","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":21467,"person_hash":"b5vz9rek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kelly Loeffler","first_name":"Kelly","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loeffler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":6803079,"votesmart_id":188718,"opensecrets_id":"N00046125","knowwho_pid":724457,"ballotpedia":"Kelly_Loeffler","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB8282","sast_bill_id":1378280}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13806,"subject_name":"News media and reporting"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13398,"subject_name":"U.S. history"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2204942,"date":"2020-08-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4292\/id\/2204942","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4292\/BILLS-116s4292is.pdf","text_size":305881,"text_hash":"47406e4b124add34dd248da39a759691"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
