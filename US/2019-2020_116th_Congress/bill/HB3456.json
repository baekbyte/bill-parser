Peace Corps volunteers and volunteer leaders shall receive a readjustment allowance of at least $417 for each month of satisfactory service, up from the current minimum of $125 per month. For workers compensation purposes, a Peace Corps volunteer shall be deemed to be paid at the minimum rate of a GS-11 employee on the General Schedule pay scale. Currently, volunteers are treated as minimum rate GS-7 employees for such purposes, while volunteer leaders are already treated as minimum rate GS-11 employees. The bill provides statutory authority for existing practices making certain former Peace Corps volunteers eligible for certain types of civil service employment. The bill also extends the eligibility period in certain instances, such as when a former volunteer applied to an agency where there was a lapse in appropriations. The bill specifies that U.S. nationals are eligible for Peace Corps employment and for related programs. (Individuals born in an outlying U.S. possession are U.S. nationals but do not automatically acquire citizenship through birth in the outlying possession.) The bill authorizes the use of the Peace Corps name as well as the official seal and emblem on the death announcement or grave marker of a person who served in the Peace Corps. The bill makes various changes to the structure and responsibilities of the Peace Corps National Advisory Council.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-25","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-25","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
