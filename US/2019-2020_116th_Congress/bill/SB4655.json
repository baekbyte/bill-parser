Specifically, the bill (1) allows financial institutions to collect interest on the entirety of certain smaller loans if a participation in the loan is sold to the special purpose vehicle established under the program, and (2) requires the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to establish a help line to address lender-specific questions. The special purpose vehicle must purchase 99% of the interest in a loan participation originated by certain financial institutions. Additionally, certain financial institutions must receive automatic preapproval for loans under the program.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-22","committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16520,"person_hash":"pw88booc","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"David Perdue","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perdue","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":12377537,"votesmart_id":151330,"opensecrets_id":"N00035516","knowwho_pid":474720,"ballotpedia":"David_Perdue","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13636,"subject_name":"Federal Reserve System"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2212479,"date":"2020-10-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4655\/id\/2212479","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4655\/BILLS-116s4655is.pdf","text_size":299658,"text_hash":"35a65acd9624155ed38432ceeb0a5c02"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
