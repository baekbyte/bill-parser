The bill also nullifies provisions in a business interruption insurance contract in force on the date of enactment that exclude such an event from coverage. An insurer may reinstate such an exclusion if (1) the insured authorizes the reinstatement in writing, or (2) the insured fails to pay the corresponding premium increase after adequate notice by the insurer of such an increase.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial
