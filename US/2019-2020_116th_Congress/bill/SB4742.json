The bill defines routine patient costs to include items and services that would otherwise be covered under Medicaid absent the patient's participation in the clinical trial; the term includes items and services relating to trial complications, but excludes those items and services that are the subject of the trial or that are provided solely in relation to data analysis and are not otherwise covered. Additionally, a qualifying clinical trial means, among other things, a clinical trial that is approved or funded by specified entities (e.g., the National Institutes of Health) or is an authorized new drug trial.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-29","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9486,"person_hash":"1riyfn00","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Burr","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burr","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NC","ftm_eid":6860429,"votesmart_id":21787,"opensecrets_id":"N00002221","knowwho_pid":158938,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Burr","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9441,"person_hash":"m9ujezsn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Benjamin Cardin","first_name":"Benjamin","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Cardin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MD","ftm_eid":8046162,"votesmart_id":26888,"opensecrets_id":"N00001955","knowwho_pid":158887,"ballotpedia":"Ben_Cardin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB913","sast_bill_id":1182195}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13645,"subject_name":"Cancer"},{"subject_id":81058,"subject_name":"Drug therapy"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13241,"subject_name":"Medical research"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213424,"date":"2020-10-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4742\/id\/2213424","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4742\/BILLS-116s4742is.pdf","text_size":301407,"text_hash":"a051b8b241b13c7c1529e5f0aba2be39"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
