(The term covered packer applies to a packer that is required to report to the Department of Agriculture each reporting day information on the price and quantity of livestock purchased by such packer and does not include a packer that owns only one livestock processing plant.) A spot market sale is a purchase and sale of livestock by a packer from a producer under (1) an agreement that specifies a firm base price that may be equated with a fixed dollar amount on the date the agreement is entered into, (2) which the livestock are slaughtered not more than 14 days after the date on which the agreement is entered into, and (3) circumstances in which a reasonable competitive bidding opportunity exists on the date on which the agreement is entered into.","pending_committee_id":3354,"committee":{"committee_id":3354,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-09","committee_id":2297,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Agriculture"},{"date":"2020-09-03","committee_id":3354,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20041,"person_hash":"3n1sakj2","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Cindy Axne","first_name":"Cindy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Axne","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-3","ftm_eid":44044592,"votesmart_id":179226,"opensecrets_id":"N00041104","knowwho_pid":627442,"ballotpedia":"Cindy_Axne","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20058,"person_hash":"pwdv9ydm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abby Finkenauer","first_name":"Abby","middle_name":"","last_name":"Finkenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-1","ftm_eid":21098123,"votesmart_id":151127,"opensecrets_id":"N00040888","knowwho_pid":491276,"ballotpedia":"Abby_Finkenauer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9082,"person_hash":"szvfzye6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Loebsack","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loebsack","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-2","ftm_eid":6321205,"votesmart_id":68964,"opensecrets_id":"N00027741","knowwho_pid":248296,"ballotpedia":"Dave_Loebsack","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB3693","sast_bill_id":1365581}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13817,"subject_name":"Agricultural marketing and promotion"},{"subject_id":13818,"subject_name":"Agricultural prices, subsidies, credit"},{"subject_id":13552,"subject_name":"Livestock"},{"subject_id":13607,"subject_name":"Meat"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2202883,"date":"2020-07-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7501\/id\/2202883","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7501\/BILLS-116hr7501ih.pdf","text_size":305624,"text_hash":"31f59ecf22e6cdefc99db73e53d51f23"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
