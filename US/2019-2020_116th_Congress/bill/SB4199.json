Among other things, the bill requires drug manufacturers to issue rebates to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for certain drugs covered under Medicare for which the average manufacturer price increases faster than inflation; requires drug manufacturers to issue rebates to the CMS for discarded amounts of certain single-dose drugs covered under Medicare, based on information reported by providers; reduces the annual out-of-pocket spending threshold, and eliminates beneficiary cost-sharing above this threshold, under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; requires the CMS to publish certain information, as reported by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), relating to drug discounts and rebates, and payments between PBMs, health plans, and pharmacies; requires pass-through pricing models, and prohibits spread-pricing, for payment arrangements with PBMs under Medicaid; and increases the maximum rebate payable by drug manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-02","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-02","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.
