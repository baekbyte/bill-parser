Specifically, for VA medical provider positions that require a person to prescribe controlled substances, the bill prohibits a person from being employed if their Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration has been terminated, revoked, or surrendered, and they have not received a waiver from the DEA. The bill also requires the VA to take prompt adverse personnel actions against a medical provider employee (1) who is not licensed, registered, certified, or in receipt of a DEA waiver; or (2) who does not promptly notify the VA of any suspension in such license, registration, or certification. Additionally, the VA must conduct biennial audits of medical provider employees to ensure they are licensed, registered, or certified as required. The VA shall ensure that the hiring process includes a request for licensure status and a verification of licensure status before an individual begins employment. Finally, the VA shall provide annual training on these licensure and employment requirements to directors of the Veterans Integrated Service Networks, as well as chiefs of staff and directors of VA health care facilities.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-27","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-07-16","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},{"date":"2019-12-18","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-16","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Subcommittee on Health Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-12-16","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-12-16","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
