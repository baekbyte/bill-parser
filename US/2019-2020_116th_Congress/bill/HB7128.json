During a public health emergency such as COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), the FAA must allow these governmental entities to enforce the reasonable restrictions on the boarding of any air passengers, including pre-board tests (e.g., temperature or other rapid check for any communicable disease which is the subject of the public health emergency) and related denial of boarding. The reasonable restrictions must be implemented at the expense of the air carriers. Additionally, during a public health emergency, the Department of Transportation must waive any grant assurance that conflicts with a reasonable restriction implemented by a state, territory, or Indian Tribe without an airport owner or operator submitting a request for such a waiver.","pending_committee_id":2549,"committee":{"committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-08","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-06-09","committee_id":2549,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Aviation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-09","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Aviation.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20045,"person_hash":"a2aso5jv","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ed Case","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Case","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-1","ftm_eid":10085353,"votesmart_id":3422,"opensecrets_id":"N00025882","knowwho_pid":193944,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Case","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13378,"subject_name":"Federal-Indian relations"},{"subject_id":13213,"subject_name":"Health promotion and preventive care"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2198284,"date":"2020-06-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7128\/id\/2198284","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7128\/BILLS-116hr7128ih.pdf","text_size":309421,"text_hash":"eed6677c9fcd773d1c527c3679f89c32"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
