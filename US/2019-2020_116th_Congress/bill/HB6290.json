The bill allows an individual taxpayer a refundable tax credit equal to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint returns) beginning in 2020. The taxpayer must be 18 years of age in 2020, a resident of the United States, and not a dependent of another taxpayer. A dependent child under age 18 shall receive a $500 credit amount. The credit is denied to certain top income earners. The Internal Revenue Service must establish an expedited process to assist taxpayers in applying for such credit. The Congressional Budget Office must report annually to Congress on alternative fiscal policies to improve readiness for future economic downturns caused by depressions, pandemics, and climate change catastrophes.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-19","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-19","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20090,"person_hash":"32tjrlyp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ilhan Omar","first_name":"Ilhan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Omar","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-5","ftm_eid":40606750,"votesmart_id":171628,"opensecrets_id":"N00043581","knowwho_pid":583510,"ballotpedia":"Ilhan_Omar","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8988,"person_hash":"2vo8uaxr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Janice Schakowsky","first_name":"Janice","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Schakowsky","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-9","ftm_eid":6419995,"votesmart_id":6387,"opensecrets_id":"N00004724","knowwho_pid":158836,"ballotpedia":"Jan_Schakowsky","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20115,"person_hash":"711pc3b4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Rashida Tlaib","first_name":"Rashida","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tlaib","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-13","ftm_eid":13002117,"votesmart_id":105368,"opensecrets_id":"N00042649","knowwho_pid":268236,"ballotpedia":"Rashida_Tlaib","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16485,"person_hash":"0vtl1zss","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bonnie Coleman","first_name":"Bonnie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-12","ftm_eid":6389632,"votesmart_id":24799,"opensecrets_id":"N00036158","knowwho_pid":362925,"ballotpedia":"Bonnie_Watson_Coleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13165,"subject_name":"Department of the Treasury"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13186,"subject_name":"Financial crises and stabilization"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13278,"subject_name":"Social Security Administration"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2176596,"date":"2020-04-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6290\/id\/2176596","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6290\/BILLS-116hr6290ih.pdf","text_size":332959,"text_hash":"d0ebae9a09bdf760eb9c1d5b54388160"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
