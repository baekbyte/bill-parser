Specifically, the bill establishes the minimum requirements for the net price calculator that an IHE must include on its website. An IHE's net price is the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at the school after deducting such aid. It authorizes the Department of Education to develop a universal net price calculator that enables users to answer one set of questions and receive net prices for several IHEs and compare those prices.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-27","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-14","action":"ASSUMING FIRST SPONSORSHIP - Mrs. Trahan asked unanimous consent that she may hereafter be considered as the first sponsor of H.R. 1915, a bill originally introduced by Representative Cummings, for the purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII.
