It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2021 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2021 begins on October 1, 2020. The CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2020 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs. In addition, the bill extends several authorities and programs, including surface transportation programs; public health, Medicare, and Medicaid authorities and programs; several authorities related to veterans benefits; the National Flood Insurance Program; the Appalachian Regional Commission; the U.S. Parole Commission; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program; and several authorities related to immigration. The bill also includes provisions that increase and expand U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services fees for providing premium processing services for certain immigration-related applications, and reauthorize a program that provides incentives (e.g., limitations on civil liability) for corporations to self-report antitrust violations to the Department of Justice.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-21","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and in addition to the Committee on the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and in addition to the Committee on the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-09-21","action":"Rules Committee Resolution H.
