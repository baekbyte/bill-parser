In determining whether to repeal such a rule, an agency must consider (1) whether the rule has achieved its purpose, has become obsolete, or overlaps with a rule to be issued; (2) any adverse effects that could materialize if the rule is repealed; and (3) whether the costs of the rule outweigh its benefits.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-12","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16523,"person_hash":"urkh79kr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Dan Sullivan","first_name":"Dan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sullivan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":39833727,"votesmart_id":114964,"opensecrets_id":"N00035774","knowwho_pid":328336,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_S._Sullivan","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1948984,"date":"2019-03-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB441\/id\/1948984","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s441\/BILLS-116s441is.pdf","text_size":279300,"text_hash":"b154cf9700776fbfe859d090f40a9699"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
