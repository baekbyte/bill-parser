Post-traumatic growth is the positive psychological change that can result from struggling with traumatic events. The bill makes veterans who are not at immediate risk of attempting suicide and not participating in traditional mental health treatment eligible for such program.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-28","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-28","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-08-05","action":"Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
