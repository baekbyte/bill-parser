Credit reporting agencies are prohibited from using social security numbers in credit reports and as a method of verifying a consumer's identity. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must supervise and examine the cybersecurity of certain credit reporting agencies. The bill prohibits a credit reporting agency from reporting paid, medically-necessary debt if the debt was paid over a year prior. A credit reporting agency is also prohibited from reporting certain adverse credit information related to financial abuse, unfair or fraudulent mortgage lending, or fraudulent private student lending. The bill extends the time credit reporting agencies have to place a credit security freeze when receiving such a request by phone or through electronic means from one to three business days. It also extends the time agencies have to remove a freeze from one hour to three days.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-18","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-18","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9372,"person_hash":"9q3ib5o9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Patrick McHenry","first_name":"Patrick","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McHenry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NC-10","ftm_eid":6009425,"votesmart_id":21031,"opensecrets_id":"N00026627","knowwho_pid":212009,"ballotpedia":"Patrick_McHenry","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14090,"person_hash":"asdkm81r","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzan DelBene","first_name":"Suzan","middle_name":"","last_name":"DelBene","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WA-1","ftm_eid":2610675,"votesmart_id":126272,"opensecrets_id":"N00030693","knowwho_pid":284676,"ballotpedia":"Suzan_DelBene","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13478,"subject_name":"Banking and financial institutions regulation"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":20665,"subject_name":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13524,"subject_name":"Consumer credit"},{"subject_id":13406,"subject_name":"Crime victims"},{"subject_id":81071,"subject_name":"Debt collection"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13220,"subject_name":"Housing finance and home ownership"},{"subject_id":13279,"subject_name":"Social security and elderly assistance"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047524,"date":"2019-07-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3821\/id\/2047524","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3821\/BILLS-116hr3821ih.pdf","text_size":372251,"text_hash":"7b3012823aa76e07fc61bf99a35ee616"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
