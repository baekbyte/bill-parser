The Department of Defense shall not provide security assistance, intelligence, training, equipment, or specified technical services to Saudi Arabia or any of its agents or instrumentalities, or engage in any defense cooperation. The bill establishes an exception to this prohibition for activities that protect U.S. diplomatic and consular posts or U.S. citizens. The President may not sell, transfer, deliver, or license for export any defense article to Saudi Arabia or any of its agents or instrumentalities, or provide any defense or construction service. Congress may pass a joint resolution to waive these prohibitions on a case-by-case basis. To request such a waiver, the President shall report to Congress on (1) how the requested activity advances U.S. national security interests, (2) the status of any investigation and prosecution of individuals responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and (3) the status of human rights protections in Saudi Arabia.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-17","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-17","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-17","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
