The bill generally aligns the age for TRICARE health care benefits with the age at which retired National Guard and Reserve personnel begin receiving their retired pay. Under current law, Reserve Component personnel may retire below age 60, but not below 50, based on active duty performance.","pending_committee_id":2299,"committee":{"committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-19","committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
