C-Band spectrum is electromagnetic spectrum between the frequencies of 3700 and 4200 megahertz. Such spectrum shall be for the provision of broadband internet access service, and the clearing and reallocation shall take place in a manner that ensures C-Band-dependent users (1) receive equal or better service than was previously available, and (2) receive such service continuously throughout the transition process. In addition, specified proceeds from such spectrum auctions shall be made available to the FCC for the build out and maintenance of rural broadband infrastructure in unserved rural communities.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-20","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-20","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18413,"person_hash":"i8432eqr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Kennedy","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kennedy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-LA","ftm_eid":13010864,"votesmart_id":35496,"opensecrets_id":"N00026823","knowwho_pid":240389,"ballotpedia":"John_Neely_Kennedy","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4855","sast_bill_id":1277894}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":324652,"subject_name":"Radio spectrum allocation"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2071354,"date":"2019-11-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2921\/id\/2071354","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2921\/BILLS-116s2921is.pdf","text_size":327245,"text_hash":"df61827fbee6ecacc98caac9718c5bcd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
