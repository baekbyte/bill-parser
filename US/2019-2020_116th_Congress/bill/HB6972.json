Specifically, the bill provides specified funds for states to support cohorting (i.e., separating and grouping) individuals in such facilities based on COVID-19 status. States may use funds for specified items and activities, including testing kits, staffing, and facility development. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must issue related guidance that includes, among other things, which facilities are permitted to cohort individuals and strategies for effective implementation; such guidance must account for certain factors, including a facility's compliance with Medicare and Medicaid requirements regarding infection control and emergency preparedness. The CMS must also provide monthly congressional briefings on the outbreak in these facilities and related agency actions.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
