The Department of State shall report to Congress an assessment of Russia and Venezuela's security cooperation and the threat it poses to countries in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States. The State Department shall also devise a strategy to address such a threat. The President shall report to Congress an assessment of the security risks posed by a potential Russian acquisition of CITGO's U.S. energy infrastructure holdings. CITGO is an energy company owned by Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA), a Venezuelan state-owned oil company. A Russian state-owned company has extended a loan to PdVSA, and a default on that loan could result in Russian ownership of CITGO.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-02-07","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8995,"person_hash":"y2h53exw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debbie Wasserman Schultz","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wasserman Schultz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-23","ftm_eid":704716,"votesmart_id":24301,"opensecrets_id":"N00026106","knowwho_pid":226499,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9157,"person_hash":"c5bhp89h","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mario Diaz-Balart","first_name":"Mario","middle_name":"","last_name":"Diaz-Balart","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-21","ftm_eid":12999048,"votesmart_id":24312,"opensecrets_id":"N00025337","knowwho_pid":193508,"ballotpedia":"Mario_Diaz-Balart","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20102,"person_hash":"nfb9loeq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Donna Shalala","first_name":"Donna","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shalala","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-27","ftm_eid":39547205,"votesmart_id":182301,"opensecrets_id":"N00042811","knowwho_pid":658165,"ballotpedia":"Donna_Shalala","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20085,"person_hash":"059pieyy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debbie Mucarsel-Powell","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mucarsel-Powell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-26","ftm_eid":41609857,"votesmart_id":173449,"opensecrets_id":"N00041561","knowwho_pid":588900,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Mucarsel-Powell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1477","sast_bill_id":1227425}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13683,"subject_name":"Alliances"},{"subject_id":13489,"subject_name":"Caribbean area"},{"subject_id":13952,"subject_name":"Collective security"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":26221,"subject_name":"Foreign property"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13235,"subject_name":"Latin America"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13870,"subject_name":"Russia"},{"subject_id":13698,"subject_name":"Venezuela"},{"subject_id":13522,"subject_name":"Homeland security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1926982,"date":"2019-02-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1102\/id\/1926982","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1102\/BILLS-116hr1102ih.pdf","text_size":277816,"text_hash":"abd140a0f447e8bee87a39db56d01961"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
