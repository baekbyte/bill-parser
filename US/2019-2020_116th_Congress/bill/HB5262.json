Specifically, the bill requires suppliers of orthotics and prosthetics to meet certain standards with respect to licensure and accreditation, physical facilities, and liability insurance. Orthotists and prosthetists may also issue written orders for commercial purposes that meet specified standards; such orders must be signed by the treating physician. The bill also prohibits payment under Medicare for certain prosthetics and orthotics that are delivered via drop shipment (i.e., direct shipment to a beneficiary who has not received corresponding patient care from a health care practitioner).","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-11-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-11-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-11-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9138,"person_hash":"s46z506o","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Thompson","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-5","ftm_eid":1952480,"votesmart_id":3564,"opensecrets_id":"N00007419","knowwho_pid":158718,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Thompson_(California)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9329,"person_hash":"7f809e7t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Glenn Thompson","first_name":"Glenn","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thompson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-5","ftm_eid":4811486,"votesmart_id":24046,"opensecrets_id":"N00029736","knowwho_pid":267269,"ballotpedia":"Glenn_Thompson_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9274,"person_hash":"e9i9kjv8","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brett Guthrie","first_name":"Brett","middle_name":"","last_name":"Guthrie","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KY-2","ftm_eid":6573540,"votesmart_id":18829,"opensecrets_id":"N00029675","knowwho_pid":194385,"ballotpedia":"Brett_Guthrie","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9016,"person_hash":"x6iqn6ks","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"G.
