These awards may be used for construction costs, space acquisition, and programmatic purposes, but they may not be used to provide capital or professional services to small businesses directly or through the subaward of funds. The organization must have the support of new small businesses as a primary purpose and be often classified as an accelerator. The term accelerator means an organization that (1) frequently provides, but is not exclusively designed to provide, seed investment in exchange for a small amount of equity; (2) works with a startup for a predetermined amount of time; (3) provides mentorship and instruction to scale businesses; or (4) offers startup capital or the opportunity to raise capital from outside investors.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-17","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":22782,"subject_name":"Business education"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13703,"subject_name":"Women in business"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047291,"date":"2019-07-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2149\/id\/2047291","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2149\/BILLS-116s2149is.pdf","text_size":378723,"text_hash":"b0065baa019197c13b00638d65dc89b5"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
