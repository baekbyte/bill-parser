The purpose of the assessments is to identify and examine specific locations with documented or perceived problems with pedestrian and bicycle safety and access, examine barriers to providing safe pedestrian and bicycle access to transportation infrastructure, and develop and issue recommendations designed to effectively address specific safety and access issues and enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety in high-risk areas. DOT must maintain a national pedestrian and bicycle safety database that includes (1) a list of high-risk intersections, roads, and highways with a documented history of pedestrian or bicycle accidents or fatalities and details regarding those incidents; and (2) information on corrective measures that have been implemented at the state, local, or federal level to enhance pedestrian and bicyclist safety at those high-risk areas, including details on the nature and date of corrective action.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-01","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-07-02","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-01","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-02","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9085,"person_hash":"6nc2hqqs","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Stephen Lynch","first_name":"Stephen","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Lynch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-8","ftm_eid":1819740,"votesmart_id":4844,"opensecrets_id":"N00013855","knowwho_pid":195035,"ballotpedia":"Stephen_Lynch","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2","sast_bill_id":1369459}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13651,"subject_name":"Accidents"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13620,"subject_name":"Pedestrians and bicycling"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2202889,"date":"2020-07-29","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7462\/id\/2202889","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7462\/BILLS-116hr7462ih.pdf","text_size":304205,"text_hash":"06b0707ba586d4e7aff718ec552890a2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
