The requirement does not apply if the Department of Agriculture reports to Congress that meeting the requirement is not possible because the quantity of the agricultural commodity available from domestically owned enterprises cannot meet the supply needs of the AMS; or would result in a greater than 150% increase between the amount necessary to purchase the agricultural commodity, and the average cost of the agricultural commodity purchased by the AMS in the prior three years.
