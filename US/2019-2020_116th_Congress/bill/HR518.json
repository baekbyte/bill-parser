It also expresses the sense that any U.S. proposal to achieve a just, stable, and lasting solution should expressly endorse a two-state solution and discourage steps that would put a peaceful resolution further out of reach.","pending_committee_id":2305,"committee":{"committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-24","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-24","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14900,"person_hash":"9tp2iqi3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alan Lowenthal","first_name":"Alan","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Lowenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-47","ftm_eid":2422636,"votesmart_id":16469,"opensecrets_id":"N00033274","knowwho_pid":193083,"ballotpedia":"Alan_Lowenthal","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8964,"person_hash":"2drw2yg6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gerald Connolly","first_name":"Gerald","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Connolly","suffix":"","nickname":"Gerry","district":"HD-VA-11","ftm_eid":16577898,"votesmart_id":95078,"opensecrets_id":"N00029891","knowwho_pid":267105,"ballotpedia":"Gerald_Connolly","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HR326","sast_bill_id":1254662},{"type_id":2,"type":"Similar To","sast_bill_number":"HR741","sast_bill_id":1286774}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"},{"subject_id":13754,"subject_name":"Arab-Israeli relations"},{"subject_id":13359,"subject_name":"Conflicts and wars"},{"subject_id":13430,"subject_name":"Diplomacy, foreign officials, Americans abroad"},{"subject_id":13755,"subject_name":"Israel"},{"subject_id":13448,"subject_name":"Middle East"},{"subject_id":20826,"subject_name":"Palestinians"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13266,"subject_name":"Religion"},{"subject_id":13463,"subject_name":"Sovereignty, recognition, national governance and status"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2047198,"date":"2019-07-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HR518\/id\/2047198","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hres518\/BILLS-116hres518ih.pdf","text_size":361437,"text_hash":"fc9f33b68c8787ef76552e35ccacaff0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
