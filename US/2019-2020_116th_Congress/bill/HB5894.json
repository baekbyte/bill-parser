On May 10, 2019, the CMS issued a final rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulation to Require Drug Pricing Transparency. The rule requires direct-to-consumer television advertisements for drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to include the list price of a 30-day supply or for a typical course of treatment, if the list price is at least $35 per month. The rule was scheduled to take effect on July 9, 2019; however, a federal court blocked the rule's implementation, citing a lack of statutory authority.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-13","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-13","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20054,"person_hash":"ue5szndm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sharice Davids","first_name":"Sharice","middle_name":"","last_name":"Davids","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KS-3","ftm_eid":15561443,"votesmart_id":181201,"opensecrets_id":"N00042626","knowwho_pid":655850,"ballotpedia":"Sharice_Davids","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20104,"person_hash":"grfgr53p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elissa Slotkin","first_name":"Elissa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Slotkin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-8","ftm_eid":44044762,"votesmart_id":181080,"opensecrets_id":"N00041357","knowwho_pid":261745,"ballotpedia":"Elissa_Slotkin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20058,"person_hash":"pwdv9ydm","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abby Finkenauer","first_name":"Abby","middle_name":"","last_name":"Finkenauer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-1","ftm_eid":21098123,"votesmart_id":151127,"opensecrets_id":"N00040888","knowwho_pid":491276,"ballotpedia":"Abby_Finkenauer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9309,"person_hash":"ro7scvdy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ed Perlmutter","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perlmutter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-7","ftm_eid":6276954,"votesmart_id":2653,"opensecrets_id":"N00027510","knowwho_pid":193129,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Perlmutter","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13593,"subject_name":"Drug safety, medical device, and laboratory regulation"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2145103,"date":"2020-02-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5894\/id\/2145103","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5894\/BILLS-116hr5894ih.pdf","text_size":317568,"text_hash":"83ba42ea84a3c8c4186ba2e7dc0413bb"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
