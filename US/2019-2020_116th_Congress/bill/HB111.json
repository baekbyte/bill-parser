(Currently, the USPS issues semipostals using its own discretion to determine the causes it considers to be in the national public interest.) The bill also makes entities (currently, only agencies) eligible to receive amounts that become available from the sale of semipostals. Congress must determine the appropriate agencies or entities that receive such amounts.","pending_committee_id":3790,"committee":{"committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":3790,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Oversight and Reform"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9176,"person_hash":"cu7fgqvh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Burgess","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Burgess","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-26","ftm_eid":17658442,"votesmart_id":50120,"opensecrets_id":"N00025219","knowwho_pid":211708,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Burgess","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13355,"subject_name":"Postal service"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1846886,"date":"2019-01-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB111\/id\/1846886","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr111\/BILLS-116hr111ih.pdf","text_size":243860,"text_hash":"166f6738a6010bdf797400624584c19a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
