A recipient of such a loan may use the funds to, among other things (1) make periodic payments of principal and interest on outstanding SBA loans; (2) provide benefits to employees such as disability insurance, sick leave, and paid family leave; (3) pay wages to employees; or (4) provide employees and patrons with the necessary items specified by a public health authority to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The SBA shall accept any available collateral to secure such a loan and shall not decline to make a loan to an otherwise eligible borrower due solely to inadequate collateral.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small
