The bill applies such immunity when the company restricts content that is unlawful rather than merely objectionable. Under current law, such immunity also applies to actions taken to enable or make available the technical means to restrict access to material that is objectionable. The bill instead specifies that this immunity applies to actions taken to (1) make available the technical means to restrict access to material that is unlawful, or (2) provide users with the option to restrict access to any material.","pending_committee_id":2358,"committee":{"committee_id":2358,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Communications and
