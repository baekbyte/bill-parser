A Move America bond is treated as a tax-exempt private facility bond with certain exceptions. At least 95% of the net proceeds from the issuance of the bond must be used for infrastructure projects, including airports; docks and wharves; mass commuting facilities; facilities for the furnishing of water; sewage facilities; railroads; certain surface transportation projects eligible for federal assistance, projects for an international bridge or tunnel, or facilities for transferring freight from truck to rail or rail to truck; flood diversions; inland waterways; or rural broadband service infrastructure. The bill specifies exceptions and modifications to existing rules for bonds regarding land acquisition, government ownership, rehabilitation expenditures, and the alternative minimum tax. The bonds are subject to a volume cap equal to 50% of a state's current private activity bond volume cap. States may exchange all or a portion of the volume cap for Move America tax credits to be allocated to taxpayers. The credits include (1) an equity credit for a portion of the basis of each qualified facility; and (2) an infrastructure fund credit for investments in qualified infrastructure funds, including a state infrastructure bank, a water pollution control revolving fund, or a drinking water treatment revolving loan fund.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-16","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-16","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11971,"person_hash":"iwcgtwmm","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Hoeven","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hoeven","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":144736,"votesmart_id":41788,"opensecrets_id":"N00031688","knowwho_pid":209683,"ballotpedia":"John_Hoeven","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9417,"person_hash":"9kl7g1rn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ron Wyden","first_name":"Ron","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wyden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":5397600,"votesmart_id":27036,"opensecrets_id":"N00007724","knowwho_pid":165265,"ballotpedia":"Ron_Wyden","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1508","sast_bill_id":1230954}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13189,"subject_name":"Floods and storm protection"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13224,"subject_name":"Income tax credits"},{"subject_id":13226,"subject_name":"Income tax exclusion"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13360,"subject_name":"Marine and inland water transportation"},{"subject_id":13421,"subject_name":"Navigation, waterways, harbors"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13281,"subject_name":"Solid waste and recycling"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13299,"subject_name":"Water resources funding"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1874322,"date":"2019-01-25","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB146\/id\/1874322","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s146\/BILLS-116s146is.pdf","text_size":177662,"text_hash":"a0e954f66165329d17195c62e0d357b7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
