Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services must designate the hospital as a facility in which a sexual assault forensic examiner is available or on call 24-7. Hospitals that do not receive this designation after one year must take action to become designated within the following year. They must also implement an interim policy that allows emergency department patients to choose to be transferred free of charge to already-designated facilities.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-10","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
