Private health insurance plans must apply cost sharing for such services that does not exceed the amount for similar services covered by the plan. Further, plans are prohibited from (1) providing incentives for plan holders to forego infertility treatment, or (2) reducing the reimbursement rate to providers of such treatments. The bill also extends infertility treatment and fertility preservation coverage to Medicaid enrollees, federal employees, members of the military, and veterans.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-14","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9413,"person_hash":"fpzplzoq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Menendez","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Menendez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":17659015,"votesmart_id":26961,"opensecrets_id":"N00000699","knowwho_pid":158964,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Menendez","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9047,"person_hash":"qm3c1xjn","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kirsten Gillibrand","first_name":"Kirsten","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Gillibrand","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":1577524,"votesmart_id":65147,"opensecrets_id":"N00027658","knowwho_pid":248345,"ballotpedia":"Kirsten_Gillibrand","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2803","sast_bill_id":1262228}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13602,"subject_name":"Military medicine"},{"subject_id":13349,"subject_name":"Sex and reproductive health"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"},{"subject_id":13302,"subject_name":"Women's health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2030535,"date":"2019-05-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB1461\/id\/2030535","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s1461\/BILLS-116s1461is.pdf","text_size":239697,"text_hash":"ae93100da63e068d5762ac2e5a7de9ab"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
