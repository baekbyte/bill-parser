The President shall appoint a Climate Security Envoy within the Department of State. The envoy shall develop, implement, and encourage other countries to support a climate security policy to (1) enhance resilience to the effects of climate change to reduce the risk of conflict and instability, (2) evaluate the risks to regions and countries that are vulnerable to climate change and are strategically significant to the United States, and (3) coordinate the integration of climate risk assessments into foreign-assistance decisions. The President shall periodically evaluate global climate disruptions, including by analyzing (1) the intensity and frequency of natural disasters, (2) the scarcity of resources including fresh water, (3) food and energy insecurities, and (4) how such conditions contribute to conflict and instability. The State Department shall designate a Special Representative for the Arctic, whose duties shall include (1) formulating U.S. policy related to resolving international disputes in the Arctic, and (2) acting as the U.S. representative in discussions with other countries on Arctic-related issues. The bill establishes that whistleblower protections shall apply to individuals reporting on what they reasonably believe to be a deliberate manipulation, removal, or misjudgment of information critical to national security assessment and planning. The President shall ensure that drafts and final reports related to federal climate security research are publicly available.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign
