The bill also directs the GAO to review annually the process for establishing and updating flood insurance rate maps and determine the degree of accuracy of the mapping process.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-13","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-06-13","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9209,"person_hash":"nnqnietk","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Gus Bilirakis","first_name":"Gus","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Bilirakis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-12","ftm_eid":12998704,"votesmart_id":17318,"opensecrets_id":"N00027462","knowwho_pid":193559,"ballotpedia":"Gus_Bilirakis","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18318,"person_hash":"k7r25dy5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Al Lawson","first_name":"Al","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lawson","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-5","ftm_eid":23377,"votesmart_id":24263,"opensecrets_id":"N00030642","knowwho_pid":193519,"ballotpedia":"Alfred_Lawson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18328,"person_hash":"jn7fz65i","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Francis Rooney","first_name":"Francis","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rooney","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-19","ftm_eid":1486745,"votesmart_id":172678,"opensecrets_id":"N00040007","knowwho_pid":588424,"ballotpedia":"Francis_Rooney","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20106,"person_hash":"plq6uczb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ross Spano","first_name":"Ross","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spano","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-15","ftm_eid":13889263,"votesmart_id":142164,"opensecrets_id":"N00043319","knowwho_pid":425567,"ballotpedia":"Ross_Spano","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14925,"person_hash":"r2dpo5e5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ted Yoho","first_name":"Ted","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yoho","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-3","ftm_eid":17657842,"votesmart_id":137622,"opensecrets_id":"N00033220","knowwho_pid":378855,"ballotpedia":"Ted_Yoho","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13477,"subject_name":"Finance and financial sector"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13439,"subject_name":"Disaster relief and insurance"},{"subject_id":13189,"subject_name":"Floods and storm protection"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2041506,"date":"2019-06-20","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3258\/id\/2041506","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3258\/BILLS-116hr3258ih.pdf","text_size":124795,"text_hash":"7cb1cfd754d6b2ef4ffc8c6d2d8f028b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
