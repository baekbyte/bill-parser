DOT must also establish a grant program to assist local educational agencies to purchase school buses equipped with three-point safety belts or any of the other safety features under this bill and assist them in modifying existing school buses to be equipped with such features.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB3959","sast_bill_id":1272234}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13162,"subject_name":"Department of Transportation"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13188,"subject_name":"Fires"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13773,"subject_name":"Motor carriers"},{"subject_id":13248,"subject_name":"Motor vehicles"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13361,"subject_name":"Transportation employees"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048179,"date":"2019-08-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2278\/id\/2048179","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2278\/BILLS-116s2278is.pdf","text_size":366502,"text_hash":"1946cf856089e14b377af1db077ba5e9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
