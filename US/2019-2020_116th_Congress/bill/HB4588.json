Under the bill, the VA may not be required to produce or retain original physical files or records, including for proceedings occurring at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The bill requires the VA to implement a process to ensure a digitized record pertaining to a claim is (1) of sufficient quality to be viewed and read on an electronic screen, and (2) an accurate reproduction of the original file or document. The VA must return an original document or file to a claimant once the digitized version has been made. Finally, the VA must resolve any doubt regarding the accuracy of a digitized file or document pertaining to a claim in favor of the claimant if (1) the VA did not implement the process to ensure the quality and accuracy of the digitized version, (2) the claimant presents credible evidence that there is a deficiency or alteration to the file, or (3) the claimant presents credible evidence that such digitized version is missing from VA records.","pending_committee_id":2597,"committee":{"committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and
