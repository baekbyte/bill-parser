Wraparound service refers to a school-based service that targets academic and non-academic barriers to student achievement, including assistance with academics and physical and mental health, provision of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, and clothing), and college and career preparation. A state educational agency that receives a grant must award subgrants to local educational agencies. A local educational agency that receives a grant or subgrant must use these funds for certain activities, such as hiring an on-site coordinator to ensure wraparound services are aligned with student needs and to connect students with those services.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-28","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-08-28","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20078,"person_hash":"3v5vyjqg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Suzanne Lee","first_name":"Suzanne","middle_name":"Kelley","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"Susie","district":"HD-NV-3","ftm_eid":9713907,"votesmart_id":169344,"opensecrets_id":"N00037247","knowwho_pid":541030,"ballotpedia":"Susie_Lee","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13125,"subject_name":"Academic performance and assessments"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":81063,"subject_name":"Educational guidance"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":81062,"subject_name":"Student records"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207753,"date":"2020-09-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8126\/id\/2207753","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8126\/BILLS-116hr8126ih.pdf","text_size":304699,"text_hash":"82c90888b1f2cf888a12877fc506d2a7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
