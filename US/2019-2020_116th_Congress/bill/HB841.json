Means-tested welfare programs are those designed to specifically provide assistance exclusively to low-income Americans. The commission shall review all federal means-tested programs, excluding various specified programs such as the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits program, Medicare, and Department of Veterans Affairs-administered programs. The commission's review shall cover topics including (1) ways to make the benefits programs more efficient and streamlined, (2) opportunities to reduce costs by contracting with private entities or delegating to states, (3) any programs that should be subject to discretionary appropriations, and (4) changes to allow caseworkers to have a holistic view of the beneficiary. The commission shall report its findings to Congress, and the report shall include proposed legislation to carry out the commission's recommendations. The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader shall introduce the proposed legislation in their respective chambers. The proposed legislation shall be considered under certain expedited procedures, such as limitations on debate.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-29","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-02-07","committee_id":4010,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management"},{"date":"2019-02-12","committee_id":4148,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States"},{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":4032,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations"},{"date":"2019-03-01","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-29","action":"Sponsor introductory remarks on measure.
