Specifically, it excludes additional types of reimbursements and payments related to organ donation from the definition of valuable consideration, such as costs for (1) dependent care; (2) certain medical expenses for up to 10 years after a donation; (3) paperwork or legal services; and (4) term life insurance policies, subject to some limitations. In addition, the federal government, states, or local governments may carry out pilot programs to evaluate the effects of removing disincentives or providing noncash benefits on the availability of organs for transplant, provided these programs meet ethical and other conditions.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-31","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-31","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14884,"person_hash":"e685qgbb","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Matthew Cartwright","first_name":"Matthew","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Cartwright","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-17","ftm_eid":15013323,"votesmart_id":136236,"opensecrets_id":"N00034128","knowwho_pid":392004,"ballotpedia":"Matt_Cartwright","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9337,"person_hash":"2w1xowbw","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Joe Wilson","first_name":"Joe","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wilson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-2","ftm_eid":6644962,"votesmart_id":3985,"opensecrets_id":"N00024809","knowwho_pid":198713,"ballotpedia":"Joe_Wilson_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9168,"person_hash":"c40vdlmx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Young","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AK","ftm_eid":17658637,"votesmart_id":26717,"opensecrets_id":"N00007999","knowwho_pid":158699,"ballotpedia":"Don_Young_(Alaska)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18304,"person_hash":"r8ccgqyg","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brian Fitzpatrick","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Fitzpatrick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-8","ftm_eid":39434649,"votesmart_id":167708,"opensecrets_id":"N00038779","knowwho_pid":568624,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Fitzpatrick","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20114,"person_hash":"sbb50n88","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"William Timmons","first_name":"William","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Timmons","suffix":"IV","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-4","ftm_eid":20742278,"votesmart_id":168923,"opensecrets_id":"N00042715","knowwho_pid":575426,"ballotpedia":"William_Timmons","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11137,"person_hash":"3ixm419p","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Kelly","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-3","ftm_eid":5007914,"votesmart_id":119463,"opensecrets_id":"N00031647","knowwho_pid":286955,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Kelly_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
