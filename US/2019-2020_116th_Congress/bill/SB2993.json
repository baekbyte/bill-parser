The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must still disapprove such programs for up to two years; however, the CMS must rescind the disapproval upon completion of corrective action and may require additional oversight of the program for purposes of rescission. The bill also allows Medicaid and Medicare providers (e.g., skilled nursing facilities) to access, through the National Practitioner Data Bank, disciplinary information for affiliated physicians and other health care practitioners, as reported by state licensing authorities.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-12-05","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-12-05","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9473,"person_hash":"2xdc4klw","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Warner","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Warner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-VA","ftm_eid":6003122,"votesmart_id":535,"opensecrets_id":"N00002097","knowwho_pid":210000,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Warner","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11074,"person_hash":"68wregy0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tim Scott","first_name":"Tim","middle_name":"","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-1","ftm_eid":6644860,"votesmart_id":11940,"opensecrets_id":"N00031782","knowwho_pid":272024,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Scott","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9425,"person_hash":"dayilu15","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Thomas Carper","first_name":"Thomas","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Carper","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-DE","ftm_eid":8428238,"votesmart_id":22421,"opensecrets_id":"N00012508","knowwho_pid":205484,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Carper","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9483,"person_hash":"sjcjzxst","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Barrasso","first_name":"John","middle_name":"","last_name":"Barrasso","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-WY","ftm_eid":10154698,"votesmart_id":52662,"opensecrets_id":"N00006236","knowwho_pid":214311,"ballotpedia":"John_Barrasso","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB4468","sast_bill_id":1275420},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2574","sast_bill_id":1275687}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13156,"subject_name":"Department of Health and Human Services"},{"subject_id":81065,"subject_name":"Employee performance"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13208,"subject_name":"Health care quality"},{"subject_id":13209,"subject_name":"Health facilities and institutions"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13237,"subject_name":"Long-term, rehabilitative, and terminal care"},{"subject_id":13239,"subject_name":"Medicaid"},{"subject_id":13240,"subject_name":"Medical education"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13888,"subject_name":"Personnel records"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2079843,"date":"2019-12-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2993\/id\/2079843","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2993\/BILLS-116s2993is.pdf","text_size":334044,"text_hash":"c827b8be1a74952b5b7aaf8dac94dbbf"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
