A high-density public land county is a county that has a population of not more than 100,000 people and in which more than 50% of the land is owned or managed by the federal government. Any requirement for local matching funds under a qualifying grant program must be reduced by 50% with respect to such jurisdictions. On request, DOT must provide additional technical assistance to such jurisdictions during the annual application period for each qualifying grant program. DOT must also prioritize grant applications from such jurisdictions that have not received support under the qualifying grant program during the 10-year period preceding the date of the application.","pending_committee_id":2526,"committee":{"committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-12-03","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-12-04","committee_id":2526,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Highways and Transit"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-12-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-04","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14918,"person_hash":"ve5gp77t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chris Stewart","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stewart","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-UT-2","ftm_eid":17658507,"votesmart_id":135930,"opensecrets_id":"N00033932","knowwho_pid":392415,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Smith_(New_Jersey)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14886,"person_hash":"rtppxfht","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Cook","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cook","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-8","ftm_eid":6553062,"votesmart_id":58121,"opensecrets_id":"N00034224","knowwho_pid":248491,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Cook_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9222,"person_hash":"js7du00v","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael Simpson","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Simpson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-ID-2","ftm_eid":7913824,"votesmart_id":2917,"opensecrets_id":"N00006263","knowwho_pid":158827,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Simpson_(Idaho)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":13318,"person_hash":"xhxpchi7","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Amodei","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Amodei","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NV-2","ftm_eid":6596644,"votesmart_id":12537,"opensecrets_id":"N00031177","knowwho_pid":197540,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Amodei","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9368,"person_hash":"pv8v5nzy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doug Lamborn","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lamborn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-5","ftm_eid":6368620,"votesmart_id":2698,"opensecrets_id":"N00028133","knowwho_pid":193118,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Lamborn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4951","sast_bill_id":1384399}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13229,"subject_name":"Infrastructure development"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13262,"subject_name":"Public transit"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2222785,"date":"2020-12-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8865\/id\/2222785","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8865\/BILLS-116hr8865ih.pdf","text_size":287023,"text_hash":"8918358a63f79f5a40bf62c71f492fe9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
