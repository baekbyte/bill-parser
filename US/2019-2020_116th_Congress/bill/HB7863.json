The amount of the tax is the excess (if any) of the tentative fair share tax over the excess of (1) the sum of the taxpayer's regular tax liability, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) amount, and the payroll tax for the taxable year; over (2) certain tax credits. The bill provides for a phase-in of such tax and requires an inflation adjustment to the $1 million income threshold for taxable years beginning after 2020. The bill also expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress should enact tax reform that repeals unfair and unnecessary tax loopholes and expenditures, simplifies the tax system, and makes sure that the wealthiest taxpayers pay a fair share of taxes.","pending_committee_id":4286,"committee":{"committee_id":4286,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-30","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-30","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11807,"person_hash":"0cn18vb4","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Cicilline","first_name":"David","middle_name":"N.","last_name":"Cicilline","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-RI-1","ftm_eid":6441236,"votesmart_id":7349,"opensecrets_id":"N00032019","knowwho_pid":198593,"ballotpedia":"David_Cicilline","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9100,"person_hash":"h8rinfel","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eleanor Norton","first_name":"Eleanor","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Norton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-DC","ftm_eid":18929695,"votesmart_id":775,"opensecrets_id":"N00001692","knowwho_pid":158782,"ballotpedia":"Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9075,"person_hash":"i5ao9u95","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Langevin","first_name":"James","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Langevin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-RI-2","ftm_eid":5029414,"votesmart_id":55787,"opensecrets_id":"N00009724","knowwho_pid":207711,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Langevin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18314,"person_hash":"mapln5bo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Ro Khanna","first_name":"Ro","middle_name":"","last_name":"Khanna","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-17","ftm_eid":373494,"votesmart_id":29473,"opensecrets_id":"N00026427","knowwho_pid":281537,"ballotpedia":"Ro_Khanna","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15234,"person_hash":"1nzjk413","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Pocan","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pocan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":17658558,"votesmart_id":26238,"opensecrets_id":"N00033549","knowwho_pid":199986,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Pocan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20117,"person_hash":"k70n0p91","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Trone","first_name":"David","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Trone","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MD-6","ftm_eid":5631712,"votesmart_id":167336,"opensecrets_id":"N00039122","knowwho_pid":568351,"ballotpedia":"David_Trone","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1707","sast_bill_id":1238910},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB768","sast_bill_id":1238953},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1726","sast_bill_id":1266898}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":13503,"subject_name":"Budget deficits and national debt"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13225,"subject_name":"Income tax deductions"},{"subject_id":13227,"subject_name":"Income tax rates"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13369,"subject_name":"Tax reform and tax simplification"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205948,"date":"2020-08-22","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7863\/id\/2205948","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7863\/BILLS-116hr7863ih.pdf","text_size":307669,"text_hash":"72dd624aa90827267ea666181d21d062"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
