The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. The amendment requires roll call votes of (1) three-fifths of each chamber of Congress to increase the public debt limit, and (2) a majority of each chamber for legislation increasing revenue. It also requires the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. Congress is authorized to waive these requirements when a declaration of war is in effect or if the United States is engaged in a military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.","pending_committee_id":4143,"committee":{"committee_id":4143,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-08","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-08","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11045,"person_hash":"u40pl0xx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve Chabot","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chabot","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-OH-1","ftm_eid":16571277,"votesmart_id":21790,"opensecrets_id":"N00003689","knowwho_pid":159001,"ballotpedia":"Steve_Chabot","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18310,"person_hash":"mpcv1p4d","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Clay Higgins","first_name":"Clay","middle_name":"","last_name":"Higgins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-LA-3","ftm_eid":41316479,"votesmart_id":174484,"opensecrets_id":"N00039953","knowwho_pid":588003,"ballotpedia":"Clay_Higgins","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9284,"person_hash":"k56piu5q","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Steve King","first_name":"Steve","middle_name":"","last_name":"King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IA-4","ftm_eid":6587767,"votesmart_id":10853,"opensecrets_id":"N00025237","knowwho_pid":193968,"ballotpedia":"Steve_King_(Iowa)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9315,"person_hash":"fcd7bhsu","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Roe","first_name":"David","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Roe","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TN-1","ftm_eid":2886736,"votesmart_id":65306,"opensecrets_id":"N00028463","knowwho_pid":267171,"ballotpedia":"Phil_Roe","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14909,"person_hash":"yggb6yb5","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Tom Rice","first_name":"Tom","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rice","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-SC-7","ftm_eid":17658351,"votesmart_id":11763,"opensecrets_id":"N00033832","knowwho_pid":392043,"ballotpedia":"Tom_Rice_(South_Carolina)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9274,"person_hash":"e9i9kjv8","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Brett Guthrie","first_name":"Brett","middle_name":"","last_name":"Guthrie","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-KY-2","ftm_eid":6573540,"votesmart_id":18829,"opensecrets_id":"N00029675","knowwho_pid":194385,"ballotpedia":"Brett_Guthrie","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9376,"person_hash":"xnpfhjo6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Pete Olson","first_name":"Pete","middle_name":"","last_name":"Olson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-22","ftm_eid":17658836,"votesmart_id":102008,"opensecrets_id":"N00029285","knowwho_pid":164975,"ballotpedia":"Pete_Olson","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":7,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18287,"person_hash":"u4dxffng","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Bacon","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bacon","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NE-2","ftm_eid":32158683,"votesmart_id":166299,"opensecrets_id":"N00037049","knowwho_pid":346086,"ballotpedia":"Don_Bacon","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":8,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11132,"person_hash":"arpp6czy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Morgan Griffith","first_name":"H.
