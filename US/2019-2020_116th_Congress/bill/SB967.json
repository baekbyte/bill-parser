First, each state must select one of the following formulas for determining the maximum cost for a service: 125% of fee-for-service rate under Medicare, the 80th percentile of the cost for such service in the geographic area, or 100% of the allowed charges if the service had been provided in network. Health insurance issuers must set the cost-sharing amount for out-of-network services at no more than the state-selected rate for such service. Further, out-of-network health care providers may charge plan holders no more than the state-selected rate for a service.Each state also must set the maximum rate for services that health care providers may charge uninsured individuals at the lower of (1) 125% of the fee-for-service rate under Medicare, (2) the 80th percentile of the cost for such service in the geographic area, or (3) the rate otherwise applicable under state law. If a state does not select a maximum rate for a service provided to an insured or uninsured individual, the maximum rate a provider may charge is (1) 125% of the fee-for-service rate under Medicare, or (2) the rate established by the Department of Health and Human Services if such service is not covered under Medicare.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-01","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9422,"person_hash":"cleoh36j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeanne Shaheen","first_name":"Jeanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shaheen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":2227644,"votesmart_id":1663,"opensecrets_id":"N00024790","knowwho_pid":209675,"ballotpedia":"Jeanne_Shaheen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13487,"subject_name":"Insurance industry and regulation"},{"subject_id":13242,"subject_name":"Medicare"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1990333,"date":"2019-04-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB967\/id\/1990333","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s967\/BILLS-116s967is.pdf","text_size":165101,"text_hash":"88ee5c7a8367be80995cf38b806454d6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
