Specifically, the bill provides supplemental appropriations for FY2020 to the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, and the Indian Health Service for various environmental cleanup and remediation projects, including those that affect low-income and tribal communities. For example, the bill appropriates $30 billion to HUD to provide grants to local governments to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards and other housing-related health and safety hazards in low-income housing. The bill immediately prohibits the granting of a Title V permit for a major proposed source (relating to air pollution control requirements) for an overburdened census tract, which is an area that has been identified as having a specified amount of particulate matter and an identified heightened risk of cancer due to air pollution. The EPA must publish a list of overburdened census tracts and update the list annually based on the most recently available modeling and monitoring data. After January 1, 2025, the bill also prohibits the renewal of Title V permits for major sources in an overburdened census tract.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-17","committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public Works"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-17","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB8271","sast_bill_id":1378221}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13645,"subject_name":"Cancer"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13158,"subject_name":"Department of Housing and Urban Development"},{"subject_id":13164,"subject_name":"Department of the Interior"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13379,"subject_name":"Indian lands and resources rights"},{"subject_id":13425,"subject_name":"Land use and conservation"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13238,"subject_name":"Low- and moderate-income housing"},{"subject_id":13244,"subject_name":"Military facilities and property"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13426,"subject_name":"Pollution liability"},{"subject_id":13269,"subject_name":"Residential rehabilitation and home repair"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13298,"subject_name":"Water quality"},{"subject_id":13394,"subject_name":"Water use and supply"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2211359,"date":"2020-10-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4617\/id\/2211359","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4617\/BILLS-116s4617is.pdf","text_size":305902,"text_hash":"09749d1b2ad8b9e4c360725fb2023b49"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
