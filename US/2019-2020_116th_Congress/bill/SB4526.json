It also provides emergency funding to the Administration on Community Living for FY2020 to increase access to such information for those who have limited English proficiency and are older individuals, individuals with disabilities, or individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Among other requirements, the CDC must award grants to, or enter cooperative agreements with, community-based organizations or governmental health departments to offer interpretive services for individuals receiving COVID-19 tests and otherwise provide information about COVID-19 and other public health activities in certain languages other than English. The CDC must also translate, within seven days, certain COVID-19 materials into specified languages other than English and must operate a hotline staffed by trained interpreters to provide information about COVID-19 to the public. In addition, any federal agency that receives funding pursuant to a COVID-19 response law must translate, within seven days, materials that describe programs and opportunities related to COVID-19 into specified languages other than English and must provide oral language assistance services to those with limited English proficiency.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And
