Expensing is the treatment of expenditures as operating costs deductible in full in the current taxable year. The bill allows a new tax deduction for 200% of the cost of purchasing or acquiring such critical minerals and metals extracted from deposits in the United States. The bill requires the Department of the Interior to establish a pilot project grant program for the development of critical minerals and metals in the United States. A grant awarded under such program may not exceed $10 million. In awarding grants, Interior must give priority to projects determined to be economically viable over the long term and must allot 30% of grants funds to the secondary recovery of critical minerals and metals.","pending_committee_id":2367,"committee":{"committee_id":2367,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
