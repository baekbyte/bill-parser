Specifically, the bill replaces the expected family contribution metric with a student aid index used to assess a family's financial need and approximate their financial resources to contribute to a student's higher education expenses. The bill also revises the process for filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and it removes certain eligibility requirements having to do with drug-related offenses and registration with the Selective Service System. In addition, the bill reauthorizes the Pell Grant program through FY2021 and establishes a new eligibility formula for Pell Grants. The Department of Education must conduct certain activities to educate students and their families about Pell Grant eligibility at a younger age.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-22","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-22","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
