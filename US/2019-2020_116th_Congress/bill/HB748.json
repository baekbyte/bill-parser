TITLE III--SUPPORTING AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CORONAVIRUS Subtitle A--Health Provisions Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act PART I--ADDRESSING SUPPLY SHORTAGES Subpart A--Medical Product Supplies (Sec. 3101) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain. (Sec. 3102) The strategic national stockpile must include personal protective equipment and supplies required for the administration of drugs, vaccines, biological products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests. (Sec. 3103) This section revises targeted liability protections with respect to certain claims arising from the use of a respiratory protective device (i.e., mask) approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Such protections shall apply if HHS declares such a device to be a priority for use during a declared public health emergency. Subpart B--Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (Sec. 3111) If notified by a manufacturer of a likely disruption in the supply of a medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must, as appropriate (1) prioritize and expedite an application review to help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage, or (2) prioritize and expedite an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage. (Sec. 3112) This section expands reporting requirements for manufacturers with respect to drug shortages and requires such manufacturers to develop risk-management plans. The FDA must periodically transmit a report of shortage drugs to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. If an FDA inspection reveals that a drug or product under shortage or interruption may have become contaminated, a report must be sent to relevant FDA personnel with drug-shortage expertise. Subpart C--Preventing Medical Device Shortages (Sec. 3121) The manufacturer of a device critical to public health during a public health emergency shall notify the FDA of an interruption or permanent discontinuance. If the FDA finds the existence of a shortage or likely shortage, it must prioritize and expedite (1) a device application review that could mitigate or prevent a shortage, or (2) an inspection or reinspection of an establishment that could mitigate or prevent a shortage. PART II--ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS Subpart A--Coverage of Testing and Preventive Services (Sec. 3201) This section expands the scope of available diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that private health insurance plans must cover. Specifically, it requires coverage of tests that have not been approved by the FDA if the developer of such a test requests, or intends to request, emergency use authorization, unless such request is denied or is not submitted within a reasonable time; the test is developed and authorized in a state that has notified HHS that the state intends to review such tests; or HHS has issued guidance that such test is appropriate. (Sec. 3202) This section specifies the process for private health insurance plan issuers to reimburse providers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Specifically, a reimbursement rate negotiated for such test prior to the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, continues to apply for the duration of the emergency. If a reimbursement rate was not negotiated prior to the emergency declaration, an issuer may either negotiate such rate or pay the provider's cash price. Additionally, test providers must publish the cash price of tests on their websites; HHS may assess a civil penalty for violations of this requirement. (Sec. 3203) This section shortens the time frame under which private health-insurance plans must cover certain new preventative services related to COVID-19. Under current law, health plans have one year to cover services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force or the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Under this section, health plans must cover such services to prevent or diagnose COVID-19 within 15 days.

(Sec. 3214) This section allows for the deployment of the Ready Reserve Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (Commissioned Corps) to serve in public health emergencies. Certain provisions related to compensation and leave without authority that apply to the Armed Forces shall also apply to officers of the Commissioned Corps or their beneficiaries. (Sec. 3215) This section extends liability protection for harm caused by acts or omissions by volunteer health care professionals in the course of providing certain health care services relating to COVID-19 during the public health emergency, in accordance with specified limitations. (Sec. 3216) This section authorizes the reassignment of members of the National Health Service Corps to provide health care services at alternative sites in response to the public health emergency, subject to the voluntary agreement of the corps members and other specified restrictions. Subpart C--Miscellaneous Provisions (Sec. 3221) This section more closely aligns the federal privacy standards applicable to substance-use disorder patient records with the relevant privacy and de-identification standards applicable to other records that contain personal health information for the purposes of (1) treatment, payment, and health care operations by health plans, providers, or clearinghouses; and (2) disclosures to public health authorities. The section requires patients to give affirmative, written consent; once given, that consent applies to future disclosures. Such consent may be revoked by written request. The section also (1) aligns criminal penalties for certain violations involving substance-use disorder patient records with the penalties that apply to violations involving other types of records containing personal health information; (2) expands the current prohibition against using substance-use disorder patient records in criminal proceedings to include any use in specified federal, state, and local criminal and civil actions; and (3) prohibits certain discrimination based on the release of such patient records with respect to access to treatment, employment, housing, and certain social services and benefits (Sec. 3222) This section allows a state agency or area agency on aging to transfer funds between congregate and home-delivered nutrition services programs for older adults without prior approval to meet the needs of the state or area served during the public health emergency. The section also (1) expands eligibility for home-delivered meals to include those who are unable to obtain nutrition because they are practicing social distancing, and (2) permits the Administration on Aging to waive certain nutrition requirements for meals provided through the nutrition services for older adults during the emergency. (Sec. 3223) This section permits the Department of Labor, in response to the effects of the public health emergency, to increase the length of time individuals may participate in, and the amount available to pay authorized administrative costs for, Community Service Employment Program projects for older adults. (Sec. 3224) This section directs HHS to issue guidance within 180 days on the sharing of protected health information during specified emergency declarations with respect to COVID-19. (Sec. 3225) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to the Healthy Start for Infants initiative, which focuses on reducing infant mortality and improving perinatal outcomes. Among other changes, the bill requires HHS to consider additional factors, such as data collection and evaluation methods, when awarding grants. In addition, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct an independent evaluation of the program. (Sec. 3226) HHS must carry out a national public awareness campaign in consultation with relevant federal agencies and other stakeholders on blood donations and the need for donations for the blood supply during the public health emergency. PART III--INNOVATION (Sec. 3301) This section eliminates the requirement for a specified written determination for the use of other transaction authority (OTA) for projects expected to cost in excess of $100 million during certain public health emergencies. (OTA allows the Biomedical Research and Development Authority to enter into certain other transactions that are generally exempt from the federal procurement laws and regulations that apply to contracts, grants and cooperative agreements.) Such transactions shall not be terminated solely due to the expiration of such a public health emergency. (Sec. 3302) The FDA must expedite the review of a new animal drug if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, alone or in combination, may prevent or treat a serious zoonotic disease (i.e., a disease that can be spread from animals to humans). PART IV--HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE (Sec. 3401) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise makes changes to specified education and training programs concerning the health professions workforce, including (1) centers related to workforce analysis and health professions education, and (2) certain loan-repayment and other educational assistance programs for specified health professionals.

(Sec. 3403) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies education and training programs related to the geriatric workforce. Among other changes, the section (1) provides specific statutory authority for the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program, which provides grants to health professions schools and other approved programs in order to improve health care for older adults and maximize patient and family engagement; and (2) revises application, reporting, and other requirements for the Geriatric Academic Career Awards, which promote career development for certain academic geriatricians or other geriatric health professionals in academic settings. (Sec. 3404) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise modifies nursing workforce education and training programs.

An IHE may provide a student with an approved leave of absence that does not require the student to return at the same point in the academic program if the student returns within the same semester. (Sec. 3509) IHEs may exclude attempted credits that were not completed as a result of a qualifying emergency from the qualitative component of the satisfactory academic progress calculation without requiring an appeal by the student.

(Sec. 3704) This section requires payment under Medicare for telehealth services furnished by federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics during the public health emergency, regardless of whether the facility and the beneficiary are at the same location. The CMS must establish a payment system for such services.

(Sec. 3715) This section allows state Medicaid programs to cover certain home- and community-based services, self-directed personal assistance services, and home- and community-based attendant services that are provided in acute care hospitals. The section specifies, among other criteria, that such services may not be duplicative of, or serve as a substitute for, necessary or obligatory hospital services. (Sec. 3718) This section exempts through 2021 private-sector laboratories from certain reporting requirements that are used to determine payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests under Medicare, and exempts such laboratories from related payment reductions for 2021.

PART V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (Sec. 3841) This section specifies requirements for the budgetary treatment of certain expenditures made under provisions of laws that are amended in this title. Subtitle F--Over-The-Counter Drugs PART I--OTC DRUG REVIEW This subtitle makes significant changes to the regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of nonprescription (i.e., over-the-counter or OTC) drugs, which typically includes products found in the drugstore aisle, such as antacids, pain relievers, and cough and cold medicines. (Sec. 3851) This part establishes a new approval process for OTC medications. Specifically, it creates an FDA administrative order process for the evaluation of OTC products, replacing the present notice and comment rulemaking approach. Under the new process, the FDA may issue an administrative order determining a specific OTC drug, class of drugs, or combination is generally regarded as safe and effective and not subject to the new drug application process. The FDA may also use the administrative order process to (1) determine a drug, class of drugs, or combination pose an imminent hazard to the public health; or (2) require labeling changes to mitigate a significant or unreasonable risk of a serious adverse event associated with use of the drug. The bill provides for market exclusivity under certain circumstances. For drugs determined to be generally regarded as safe and effective pursuant to an administrative order requested by a sponsor (rather than initiated by the FDA), the requestor is granted 18 months of market exclusivity. This market exclusivity applies to an OTC drug with a new active ingredient or where the requestor conducted new human studies to get approval. The Government Accountability Office must review the impact of granting market exclusivity to such OTC sponsors, including the impact on innovation. (Sec. 3852) OTC drugs that do not comply with the requirements in this part are deemed misbranded (i.e., improperly labeled). (Sec. 3853) The new requirements do not apply to any OTC product that was marketed in the United States before May 11, 1972. (Sec. 3854) This section allows a sponsor of a nonprescription sunscreen active ingredient or a combination of such ingredients that was subject to a proposed sunscreen order to transition to the administrative order process. Market exclusivity provisions also apply to new sunscreen active ingredients. (Sec. 3855) The FDA must report on its progress updating the monograph for cough and cold medicines with respect to children under the age of six. (Sec. 3856) The section makes technical corrections related to the new OTC requirements. PART II--USER FEES (Sec. 3862) This part establishes a user fee program for OTC drugs under which the FDA must assess user fees on persons who own an OTC facility or who request an administrative order for an OTC drug. TITLE IV--ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND ASSISTANCE TO SEVERELY DISTRESSED SECTORS OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Subtitle A--Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 (Sec. 4003) This section authorizes the Department of the Treasury to make loans, loan guarantees, and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states, and municipalities. Such funds shall be made available for (1) passenger air carriers, ticket agents, and aircraft repair stations; (2) cargo air carriers; (3) businesses critical to maintaining national security; and (4) programs or facilities established by the Federal Reserve Board for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system that supports lending to eligible businesses, states, or municipalities. Treasury may not issue a loan to, or a loan guarantee for, an eligible business unless Treasury receives a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business or a senior debt instrument issued by the business. A loan or guarantee recipient is prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing stock while the loan or guarantee is outstanding or for 12 months following repayment. Furthermore, a recipient may not reduce its employment levels by more than 10% from its levels as of March 24, 2020. The section directs Treasury to endeavor to establish a program to provide low-interest loans for mid-sized businesses (businesses with between 500 and 10,000 employees). Treasury may not require repayment of such loans for at least six months. Treasury may designate financial institutions as financial agents of the United States and require them to perform all reasonable duties necessary to respond to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak. Any loan made or guaranteed by Treasury pursuant to this subtitle shall be treated as indebtedness for tax purposes. (Sec. 4004) This section limits the maximum allowable compensation of an officer or employee of a business that receives a loan or a loan guarantee from Treasury under this subtitle. (Sec. 4005) The Department of Transportation (DOT) may temporarily require an air carrier receiving such a loan or loan guarantee to maintain scheduled air transportation service deemed necessary to ensure services to any point served by that carrier prior to March 1, 2020. (Sec. 4006) This section requires Treasury to coordinate with DOT in implementing this subtitle with respect to air carriers. (Sec. 4007) This section suspends the imposition of certain aviation excise taxes until January 1, 2021. (Sec. 4008) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may establish a temporary debt guarantee program for solvent insured depository institutions and solvent depository institution holding companies. The National Credit Union Administration may temporarily increase the share insurance coverage on any non-interest-bearing transaction account in any federally insured credit union.

The board must keep a record of all votes and the reasons behind these votes during this period.

(Sec. 4012) Leverage-ratio requirements for community banks are temporarily eased. (Sec. 4013) Financial institutions may temporarily suspend (1) determinations of a loan modification related to the COVID-19 outbreak as being a troubled debt restructuring, and (2) accounting requirements for such loan modifications. Federal banking agencies must defer to a financial institution's determination to suspend these requirements. (Sec. 4014) Insured depository institutions and bank holding companies may delay their compliance with certain accounting standards applicable to credit losses (i.e., current expected credit losses standards, also known as CECL standards). (Sec. 4015) This section allows the Department of the Treasury to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund for guaranty programs for the U.S. money-market mutual-fund industry. Any guarantee must (1) be limited to the value of a shareholder's account in a money-market fund as of the close of business the day before the announcement of the guarantee, and (2) terminate no later than December 31, 2020. The Exchange Stabilization Fund must be reimbursed, upon termination of this authority, to the extent that payments made exceed fees collected. (Sec. 4016) Certain membership, credit-extension, and borrowing restrictions regarding the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility are temporarily waived. (Sec. 4017) This section temporarily waives requirements related to the President's authority to provide economic incentives for domestic industries that expand production of essential materials and goods needed for the national defense. Specifically, balance requirements for the Defense Production Act Fund, outstanding loan limits for private business enterprises, and congressional notification and approval requirements related to the cost of resource-shortfall requests are waived for a specified period of time. (Sec. 4018) This section establishes the Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery within Treasury. Among other things, the office must conduct audits and investigations of loans, loan guarantees, and other investments made by Treasury under this subtitle; perform audits and investigations of the management by Treasury of programs established under this subtitle; track the status and amounts of outstanding loans, loan guarantees, and other investments; gather information related to the recipients of loans, loan guarantees, or other investments; and record Treasury's justification for transactions under this subtitle.

The office is abolished five years after enactment. Treasury must take action to address problems identified by a report or investigation of the office, or certify to Congress that Treasury determines no action is necessary. (Sec. 4019) Certain entities are prohibited from receiving loans, loan guarantees, and other investments as provided by this subtitle. Specifically, an entity is not eligible for these programs if a controlling interest in the entity is held by the President; the Vice President; the head of an executive department; a Member of Congress; or the spouse, child, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law of any of the above. For determining eligibility, the interests of two or more related individuals in an entity are aggregated. Any entity seeking to receive loans, loan guarantees, and other investments as provided by this subtitle must certify to the Federal Reserve Board that it is not in violation of these conflict-of-interest restrictions. (Sec. 4020) This section establishes the Congressional Oversight Commission. The commission must conduct oversight of the implementation of this subtitle by Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, including efforts by Treasury and the board to provide economic stability in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The commission must report to Congress monthly and must generally review the implementation of this subtitle by the federal government. The commission may hold hearings, take testimony, and receive evidence in the course of carrying out its duties. (Sec. 4021) If a furnisher of credit information provides an accommodation to a consumer affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the consumer complies with the terms of the accommodation, the creditor generally must report the account as current. (Sec. 4022) Borrowers who have federally backed mortgages and are experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 outbreak may request a forbearance on their mortgage payments. This forbearance is for up to 180 days and may be extended for an additional time period of up to 180 days. No additional fees, penalties, or interest beyond those applicable if the borrower made all payments on time may be applied to a mortgage in forbearance. A servicer of a federally backed mortgage may not initiate a foreclosure for 60 days beginning on March 18, 2020, unless the property is abandoned or vacant. Such a servicer is further prohibited from executing a foreclosure-related eviction or sale during this period. (Sec. 4023) Multifamily-property loan borrowers who have federally backed mortgages and are experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 outbreak may request a forbearance on their mortgage payments. This forbearance is for 30 days and may be extended for an additional 60 days.

(Sec. 4024) Tenants in specified federally backed housing (e.g., federally subsidized housing, rural voucher-program housing, and housing financed through federally backed mortgages) may not be evicted for 120 days beginning on the date of enactment of this subtitle. A lessor that serves an eviction notice after this time period must provide the tenant with 30 days to vacate. Furthermore, during the 120-day moratorium, tenants may not be charged late fees, penalties, or other charges for nonpayment of rent.
