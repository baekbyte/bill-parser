Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Defense to report on the goals and incentives used to increase awards of SBIR and STTR contracts; prioritizes innovation in manufacturing and cybersecurity; directs federal agencies to issue Phase III awards to technology developers without requiring further competition; requires agencies' senior procurement executives to coordinate with SBIR and STTR program officers to assist small businesses; requires the SBA to conduct outreach efforts at minority institutions and Hispanic-serving institutions; makes permanent (as the Civilian Agency Commercialization Readiness Program) the pilot program that a covered agency may establish for awarding SBIR and STTR Phase II and III funds for technology development and progression toward commercialization; requires all agencies participating in the SBIR program to establish a Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program to make SBIR Phase II awards to commercialize a project undertaken by a small business with SBIR Phase I awards; authorizes specified agencies to use a percentage of STTR funds for a Proof of Concept Partnership pilot program to accelerate the creation of small businesses and the commercialization of research innovations; and authorizes all agencies participating in the SBIR program, during FY2020-FY2024, to provide a SBIR Phase II award for a project to a small business concern without regard to whether such concern was provided a Phase I award for such project.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small
