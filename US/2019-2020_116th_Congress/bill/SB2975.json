In providing financial assistance, Reclamation must prioritize projects that (1) prevent the spread of an aquatic invasive species to waters under its jurisdiction, including irrigation, reclamation, or other water projects; and (2) align with the priorities of the state and with the document titled Quagga-Zebra Mussel Action Plan for Western U.S. Waters, published in February 2010. The bill provides authority for each federal agency on the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to (1) conduct mandatory inspections and decontamination of watercraft; and (2) if necessary, impound, quarantine, or otherwise prevent entry of a watercraft. The membership of the task force is expanded to include the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Reclamation.","pending_committee_id":2325,"committee":{"committee_id":2325,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Environment And Public
