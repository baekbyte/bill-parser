Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice, must award grants to eligible partnerships to establish or expand these models. The partnerships must consist of a unit of local or tribal government that is independent of law enforcement agencies and a nonprofit, community-based organization or consortium of such organizations. The partnerships may also include other entities, such as nonprofit or public institutions of higher education and behavioral health organizations. A partnership may use grant funds for a variety of purposes, such as triaging 9\u20131\u20131 calls to refer certain emergencies to entities other than law enforcement. In awarding these grants, HHS must prioritize partnerships that include community-based organizations that have a record of effectively serving, and are led by members of, vulnerable populations.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-10-01","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-10-01","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB4791","sast_bill_id":1379665}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13383,"subject_name":"Social welfare"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13128,"subject_name":"Aging"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13763,"subject_name":"Community life and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13429,"subject_name":"Crime prevention"},{"subject_id":13406,"subject_name":"Crime victims"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13660,"subject_name":"Domestic violence and child abuse"},{"subject_id":13307,"subject_name":"Drug, alcohol, tobacco use"},{"subject_id":13495,"subject_name":"Emergency communications systems"},{"subject_id":20790,"subject_name":"First responders and emergency personnel"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13217,"subject_name":"Homelessness and emergency shelter"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13311,"subject_name":"Immigrant health and welfare"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13726,"subject_name":"Sex offenses"},{"subject_id":13326,"subject_name":"Sex, gender, sexual orientation discrimination"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2219851,"date":"2020-12-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8474\/id\/2219851","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8474\/BILLS-116hr8474ih.pdf","text_size":312443,"text_hash":"b92b57a425ca12e2ae25ab81e5fac80e"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
