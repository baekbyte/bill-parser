The Department of Health and Human Services must disseminate guidance on respectful maternal care delivery that covers, among other topics, recruiting and retaining maternity care providers from diverse backgrounds and incorporating trained midwives, doulas, and others in maternity care teams. In addition, the National Institutes of Health must study best practices and make recommendations for culturally congruent maternity care (i.e., care that is in agreement with the preferred cultural values, beliefs, worldview, and practices of the health care consumer and other stakeholders). The Government Accountability Office must report on specified information related to certain perinatal health care professions, with a particular focus on barriers to entering such professions faced by low-income and minority women.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
