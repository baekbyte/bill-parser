The USGS shall, among other things develop and publish a national strategy for landslide hazards, risk reduction, and response in the United States (including territories); develop and maintain a publicly accessible national landslide hazard and risk inventory database; expand the early warning system for debris flow; and establish emergency response procedures for the rapid deployment of federal scientists, equipment, and services to areas impacted by a significant landslide event. The USGS may provide grants to research, map, assess, and collect data on landslide hazards. The National Science Foundation may provide grants to eligible entities for landslide research. The USGS (1) shall establish the 3D Elevation Program and the 3D Elevation Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee, and (2) may make grants and enter into cooperative agreements to facilitate the improvement of nationwide coverage of 3D elevation data.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-02-14","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-02-14","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-03","action":"Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
