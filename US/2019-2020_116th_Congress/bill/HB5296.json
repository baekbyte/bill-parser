The bill sets forth a special rule for parents who do not qualify for the full refundable portion of the child tax credit. The advance amount for such parents is the lesser of $5,000, or 25% of their earned income amount for the taxable year. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on matters relating to taxpayers who make an election to advance the child tax credit.","pending_committee_id":2317,"committee":{"committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And
