The bill authorizes additional housing assistance, including rental assistance, for (1) low-income individuals with families, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness; (2) the elderly; (3) individuals with disabilities; and (4) rural renters. In addition, the bill establishes a 12-month moratorium on evictions covering all tenants, whereas the previously enacted moratorium covered only tenants of federally assisted properties. Similarly, the bill establishes a 12-month moratorium on foreclosures that covers all tenants, whereas the previously enacted moratorium covered only federally backed mortgages. The bill also establishes an automatic 60-day forbearance (i.e., suspension of mortgage payments) for a single-family mortgage that becomes delinquent by 60 days during the public health emergency. Under current law, the borrower must request a forbearance. This automatic forbearance also applies to certain reverse mortgages. The bill extends the maximum period of forbearance for multifamily mortgages from 90 days to 12 months. Additionally, the bill establishes a six-month moratorium on the repossession of personal property used as a dwelling. The bill also provides additional bankruptcy protections by (1) increasing the homestead exemption (generally, the equity in a residence that is protected from creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding) from $15,000 to $100,000, and (2) expanding eligibility for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-24","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-24","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-24","action":"Referred to the Committee on Financial Services, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-06-24","action":"Rules Committee Resolution H.
