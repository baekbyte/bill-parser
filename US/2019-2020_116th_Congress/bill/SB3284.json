Specifically, it prohibits any such individual from setting up a camera to be used in connection with facial recognition technology, accessing or using information obtained from such technology, or importing such technology to identify an individual in the United States until Congress enacts legislation implementing the guidelines established by the commission. The bill permits an aggrieved person to bring a civil action for injunctive or declaratory relief in the appropriate U.S. district court. No federal funds may be used by a state or local government to invest in facial recognition software, purchase facial recognition technology services, or acquire images for use in facial recognition technology systems.","pending_committee_id":2329,"committee":{"committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-02-12","committee_id":2329,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-02-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9469,"person_hash":"58q1t500","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Merkley","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Merkley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OR","ftm_eid":13005237,"votesmart_id":23644,"opensecrets_id":"N00029303","knowwho_pid":198129,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Merkley","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16055,"person_hash":"39h7tph8","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Cory Booker","first_name":"Cory","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Booker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NJ","ftm_eid":1987417,"votesmart_id":76151,"opensecrets_id":"N00035267","knowwho_pid":462025,"ballotpedia":"Cory_Booker","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13321,"subject_name":"Civil rights and liberties, minority issues"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13144,"subject_name":"Computers and information technology"},{"subject_id":13466,"subject_name":"Congressional operations and organization"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13443,"subject_name":"Crimes against children"},{"subject_id":13373,"subject_name":"Criminal investigation, prosecution, interrogation"},{"subject_id":13499,"subject_name":"Due process and equal protection"},{"subject_id":13663,"subject_name":"First Amendment rights"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13199,"subject_name":"Government ethics and transparency, public corruption"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13500,"subject_name":"Intelligence activities, surveillance, classified information"},{"subject_id":13591,"subject_name":"Legislative rules and procedure"},{"subject_id":322231,"subject_name":"Missing persons"},{"subject_id":13664,"subject_name":"Photography and imaging"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13325,"subject_name":"Racial and ethnic relations"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2142601,"date":"2020-02-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3284\/id\/2142601","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3284\/BILLS-116s3284is.pdf","text_size":338675,"text_hash":"46f9ac6e1a45a07086dcd72a839dfc69"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
