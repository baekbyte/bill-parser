Among other requirements, the bill (1) requires grant awards for large projects (projects with total costs of greater than $100 million) to be at least $50 million, and for any other projects not less than $2.5 million; and (2) directs the Department of Transportation to consider a number of factors in awarding grants, including accident history at the rail-highway crossing over the last 10 years, the annual average daily traffic at the crossing, the likelihood of a collision based on the geometry of the crossing, and the number of critical facilities near the crossing.","pending_committee_id":2527,"committee":{"committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2315,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Transportation And Infrastructure"},{"date":"2020-03-13","committee_id":2527,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-03-13","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9081,"person_hash":"p0oi2l64","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Lipinski","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipinski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-3","ftm_eid":17658586,"votesmart_id":33692,"opensecrets_id":"N00027239","knowwho_pid":226508,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_Lipinski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":13651,"subject_name":"Accidents"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13705,"subject_name":"Noise pollution"},{"subject_id":13265,"subject_name":"Railroads"},{"subject_id":13271,"subject_name":"Roads and highways"},{"subject_id":13291,"subject_name":"Transportation programs funding"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2176494,"date":"2020-03-31","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6224\/id\/2176494","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6224\/BILLS-116hr6224ih.pdf","text_size":349069,"text_hash":"0d1f9a2d38cdb61d4785fc39f9944e03"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
