Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must conduct a nationwide testing program to (1) detect and document differences in the treatment of prospective renters, homebuyers, or mortgage borrowers; (2) measure patterns of adverse treatment because of the race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability status, or national origin of a renter, homebuyer, or borrower; and (3) measure the prevalence of such discriminatory practices across housing and mortgage lending markets. The bill also increases funding for the fair housing initiative program in FY2020-FY2024. Additionally, HUD shall implement a grant program to assist public and private nonprofit organizations in (1) conducting comprehensive studies of the causes and effects of housing discrimination and segregation on education, poverty, and economic development or on veterans and military personnel; and (2) implementing pilot projects that test solutions to help prevent or alleviate housing discrimination and segregation.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-27","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-28","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-28","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by the Yeas and Nays: 33 - 25.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-12-17","action":"Reported (Amended) by the Committee on Financial Services.
