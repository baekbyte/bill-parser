Specifically, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is authorized to provide second draw loans of up to $2 million under the Paycheck Protection Program. A recipient shall be eligible for forgiveness of a second draw loan in the same manner as an initial paycheck protection loan. The SBA may also provide loans of up to $10 million to recovery sector small businesses (e.g., certain seasonal businesses and businesses located in low-income census tracts) to meet working capital needs, acquire fixed assets, or refinance existing indebtedness while recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other requirements, a loan recipient must demonstrate at least a 50% reduction in gross revenues. Further the bill modifies the Paycheck Protection Program by, among other things, (1) expanding forgivable expenses, (2) allowing borrowers to select an eight-week period through December 31, 2020, to use their paycheck protection loan, (3) simplifying the forgiveness application for smaller loans, (4) expanding eligibility to certain chambers of commerce and destination marketing organizations, and (5) establishing a specific loan calculation for farmers and ranchers. Lastly, the SBA must establish and carry out a facility to improve the recovery of eligible small businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic, increase resiliency in the manufacturing supply chain of small businesses, and increase economic development of small business low-income census tracts by providing financial assistance to participating investment companies that facilitate equity financing to eligible small businesses.","pending_committee_id":2332,"committee":{"committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-27","committee_id":2332,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Small Business And Entrepreneurship"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9459,"person_hash":"f0qn5jvf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Collins","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":10045641,"votesmart_id":379,"opensecrets_id":"N00000491","knowwho_pid":165234,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Collins_(Maine)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7175","sast_bill_id":1369501},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB3918","sast_bill_id":1369171},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8087","sast_bill_id":1376856},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8265","sast_bill_id":1378206}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13818,"subject_name":"Agricultural prices, subsidies, credit"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13372,"subject_name":"Bankruptcy"},{"subject_id":13768,"subject_name":"Business ethics"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"},{"subject_id":13139,"subject_name":"Business investment and capital"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13148,"subject_name":"Corporate finance and management"},{"subject_id":13414,"subject_name":"Crimes against property"},{"subject_id":13168,"subject_name":"Economic development"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13175,"subject_name":"Employee benefits and pensions"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13199,"subject_name":"Government ethics and transparency, public corruption"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13588,"subject_name":"Members of Congress"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13652,"subject_name":"Public participation and lobbying"},{"subject_id":13273,"subject_name":"Securities"},{"subject_id":13275,"subject_name":"Small Business Administration"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2202647,"date":"2020-07-28","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4321\/id\/2202647","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4321\/BILLS-116s4321is.pdf","text_size":437903,"text_hash":"072e03f2fc24bdc3cc4c713a9895c264"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
