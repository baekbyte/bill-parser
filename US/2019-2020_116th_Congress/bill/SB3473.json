Specifically, the bill requires open captioning and an American Sign Language option for persons with disabilities when the information and programming are available to passengers through shared video displays, such as a monitor located in a passenger access aisle; closed captioning and an American Sign Language option when the information and programming are available to passengers through individual video displays; video descriptions when the information and programming are available to passengers through individual video displays or shared video displays; an aural public address announcement in textual format through individual video displays or shared video displays; and control systems for video displays to have a nonvisual operating option. A civil action may be brought in a U.S. District Court against an air carrier for violations of these requirements. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board must set forth the minimum technical criteria for individual video displays to ensure that they include a mechanism that allows persons with disabilities to operate the displays nonvisually.","pending_committee_id":2323,"committee":{"committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-12","committee_id":2323,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Commerce, Science, And Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-12","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9403,"person_hash":"dbwfjn2h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Robert Casey","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"Casey","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Bob","district":"SD-PA","ftm_eid":5967054,"votesmart_id":2541,"opensecrets_id":"N00027503","knowwho_pid":240529,"ballotpedia":"Robert_Casey_(Pennsylvania)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9004,"person_hash":"mzzpsyfc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Baldwin","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baldwin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-WI-2","ftm_eid":2924660,"votesmart_id":3470,"opensecrets_id":"N00004367","knowwho_pid":159127,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Baldwin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8981,"person_hash":"hdvrlylp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Edward Markey","first_name":"Edward","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Markey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-5","ftm_eid":17658675,"votesmart_id":26900,"opensecrets_id":"N00000270","knowwho_pid":158881,"ballotpedia":"Edward_Markey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9402,"person_hash":"bsdo1kgr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Sherrod Brown","first_name":"Sherrod","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-OH","ftm_eid":3439679,"votesmart_id":27018,"opensecrets_id":"N00003535","knowwho_pid":159013,"ballotpedia":"Sherrod_Brown","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15053,"person_hash":"k23gdpqr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tammy Duckworth","first_name":"Tammy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Duckworth","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-IL","ftm_eid":17658669,"votesmart_id":57442,"opensecrets_id":"N00027860","knowwho_pid":264841,"ballotpedia":"Tammy_Duckworth","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11199,"person_hash":"crmbr7rg","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Richard Blumenthal","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blumenthal","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CT","ftm_eid":6378136,"votesmart_id":1568,"opensecrets_id":"N00031685","knowwho_pid":218586,"ballotpedia":"Richard_Blumenthal","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13531,"subject_name":"Transportation and public works"},{"subject_id":20814,"subject_name":"Access Board"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13135,"subject_name":"Aviation and airports"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13608,"subject_name":"Hearing, speech, and vision care"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13292,"subject_name":"Transportation safety and security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2175869,"date":"2020-03-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3473\/id\/2175869","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3473\/BILLS-116s3473is.pdf","text_size":326762,"text_hash":"c408c3c7e2e0bdfd29a4e50d61bc5fd0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
