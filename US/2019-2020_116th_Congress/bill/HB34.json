Specifically, the DOE must develop and implement a strategic plan that advances energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices to minimize freshwater withdrawal and consumption, seismic impacts, and deleterious impacts on water bodies, groundwater, and waterways; increase water use efficiency; and utilize nontraditional water sources. Further, the strategic plan must (1) consider the effects climate variability may have on water supplies and quality for energy generation and fuel production, and (2) improve the understanding of the energy required to provide reliable water supplies as well as the water required to provide reliable energy supplies. The plan must be updated every five years. In addition, DOE must establish an Energy-Water Committee to promote and enable improved energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"},{"date":"2019-02-12","committee_id":2933,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Energy"},{"date":"2019-07-24","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-02-12","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Energy.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-27","action":"Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee (Amended) by Voice Vote .","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-01","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Ms. Johnson (TX) moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-23","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
