It also prioritizes the allocation of credit amounts for investment in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities and requires an allocation of at least 10% of credit amounts to certain Indian community development entities for investments that primarily serve low-income communities. The bill directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior to provide technical assistance to qualified Indian community development entities regarding applications for allocations of the new markets tax credit and to work with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to provide assistance to such entities.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-09","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-09","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9491,"person_hash":"isieh7x3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lisa Murkowski","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murkowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":6604204,"votesmart_id":15841,"opensecrets_id":"N00026050","knowwho_pid":192554,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Murkowski","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14081,"person_hash":"uqrd4tgh","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Brian Schatz","first_name":"Brian","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-HI","ftm_eid":6397188,"votesmart_id":17852,"opensecrets_id":"N00028138","knowwho_pid":193945,"ballotpedia":"Brian_Schatz","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9061,"person_hash":"yqm2ur4v","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mazie Hirono","first_name":"Mazie","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Hirono","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-HI-2","ftm_eid":6401094,"votesmart_id":1677,"opensecrets_id":"N00028139","knowwho_pid":248294,"ballotpedia":"Mazie_Hirono","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16523,"person_hash":"urkh79kr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Dan Sullivan","first_name":"Dan","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sullivan","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":39833727,"votesmart_id":114964,"opensecrets_id":"N00035774","knowwho_pid":328336,"ballotpedia":"Daniel_S._Sullivan","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13338,"subject_name":"Taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2097701,"date":"2020-01-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3181\/id\/2097701","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3181\/BILLS-116s3181is.pdf","text_size":329062,"text_hash":"f95fbf4edb6f7433a80c6359f08214de"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
