The bill authorizes the President to grant exemptions from this prohibition if it is necessary to protect national security interests and no feasible alternative exists for the intended use of the asbestos-containing product. Any person who has manufactured, processed, or distributed asbestos or any mixture or article containing asbestos in the 36 months preceding the enactment of this bill (as well as those acting within the year after enactment but before the prohibition takes effect) must submit a report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including information such as the location of the facility where the manufacturing occurred. Additionally, the EPA must submit a report assessing the presence of asbestos in any residential, commercial, industrial, public, and school buildings as well as the extent of exposure and risk to human health. The report must include recommendations for modifications or additions to statutes, regulations, policies, and programs aimed at protecting against exposures to legacy asbestos.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-07","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And
