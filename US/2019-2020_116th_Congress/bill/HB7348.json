These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing. Specifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a two-phase study and report on the research and development needed to advance human exposure estimation and toxicity hazard estimation of individual or total PFAS. The bill also requires the EPA to jointly enter into an agreement with NASEM to conduct a study and submit a report on the research and development needed to advance the understanding of the extent and implications of environmental contamination by PFAS, how to manage and treat such contamination, and the development of safe alternatives. Finally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy must submit an implementation plan for federal PFAS research, development, and demonstration activities, taking into account the recommendations of the NASEM reports.","pending_committee_id":2313,"committee":{"committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-25","committee_id":2313,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Science, Space, And Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-06-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20059,"person_hash":"xs2edxvf","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Fletcher","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"Pannill","last_name":"Fletcher","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-7","ftm_eid":44045104,"votesmart_id":177031,"opensecrets_id":"N00041194","knowwho_pid":625330,"ballotpedia":"Lizzie_Pannill_Fletcher","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20104,"person_hash":"grfgr53p","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elissa Slotkin","first_name":"Elissa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Slotkin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-8","ftm_eid":44044762,"votesmart_id":181080,"opensecrets_id":"N00041357","knowwho_pid":261745,"ballotpedia":"Elissa_Slotkin","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9197,"person_hash":"cw1v2ewn","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Posey","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posey","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-8","ftm_eid":12998616,"votesmart_id":24280,"opensecrets_id":"N00029662","knowwho_pid":193543,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Posey","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13881,"subject_name":"Animal and plant health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13333,"subject_name":"Environmental assessment, monitoring, research"},{"subject_id":13740,"subject_name":"Environmental health"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13205,"subject_name":"Hazardous wastes and toxic substances"},{"subject_id":13640,"subject_name":"Product safety and quality"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13268,"subject_name":"Research and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2201293,"date":"2020-07-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB7348\/id\/2201293","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr7348\/BILLS-116hr7348ih.pdf","text_size":312637,"text_hash":"6fe3fb1b594955e7fcfaffcde2f52354"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
