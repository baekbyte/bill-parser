Among other elements, the required study must (1) identify oversight practices that U.S communities implement to mitigate the risks of foreign espionage and economic coercion within sister city partnerships, (2) assess the extent to which U.S. communities ensure transparency regarding sister city partnership contracts and activities, and (3) review the range of activities conducted within sister city partnerships.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-11-16","committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign Relations"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-11-16","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9172,"person_hash":"e1pw64ek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marsha Blackburn","first_name":"Marsha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Blackburn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":6654369,"votesmart_id":25186,"opensecrets_id":"N00003105","knowwho_pid":198986,"ballotpedia":"Marsha_Blackburn","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20295,"person_hash":"r2b3zv8g","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Josh Hawley","first_name":"Joshua","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hawley","suffix":"","nickname":"Josh","district":"SD-MO","ftm_eid":16205449,"votesmart_id":169716,"opensecrets_id":"N00041620","knowwho_pid":572072,"ballotpedia":"Josh_Hawley","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11910,"person_hash":"8u29wj1z","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Marco Rubio","first_name":"Marco","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rubio","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-FL","ftm_eid":12999040,"votesmart_id":1601,"opensecrets_id":"N00030612","knowwho_pid":193597,"ballotpedia":"Marco_Rubio","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13422,"subject_name":"International affairs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2217752,"date":"2020-12-01","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4899\/id\/2217752","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4899\/BILLS-116s4899is.pdf","text_size":291771,"text_hash":"30541b823fdd72469e1c62d72406a358"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
