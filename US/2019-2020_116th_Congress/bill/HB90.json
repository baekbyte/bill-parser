Specifically, the bill exempts individuals from the requirement to maintain minimum essential health care coverage if they reside in a county where fewer than two health insurers offer insurance on the health insurance exchange. (Under current law, effective January 1, 2019, there is no penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health care coverage.) The bill also requires certain executive branch and congressional employees to participate in health insurance exchanges. Under current law, Members of Congress and their designated staff are required to obtain coverage through health insurance exchanges, rather than the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Current regulations authorize government contributions toward such coverage and require Members of Congress to designate which members of their staff are required to obtain coverage through an exchange. The bill requires all congressional staff, including employees of congressional committees and leadership offices, to obtain coverage through an exchange. The bill also prohibits Members of Congress from having the discretion to determine which of their employees are eligible to enroll through an exchange. Further, the President, Vice President, and executive branch political appointees must also obtain coverage through exchanges, rather than FEHB. The government is prohibited from contributing to or subsidizing the health insurance coverage of the officials and employees subject to this requirement, including Members of Congress and their staff.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":2317,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Ways And Means"},{"date":"2019-01-25","committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, House Administration, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, House Administration, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, House Administration, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, House Administration, and Oversight and Reform, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-25","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-31","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Health.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18291,"person_hash":"3fg4gjfb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andy Biggs","first_name":"Andy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Biggs","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-5","ftm_eid":6602301,"votesmart_id":28088,"opensecrets_id":"N00039293","knowwho_pid":212155,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Biggs","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13356,"subject_name":"Government operations and politics"},{"subject_id":13677,"subject_name":"Congressional committees"},{"subject_id":13827,"subject_name":"Congressional leadership"},{"subject_id":13585,"subject_name":"Congressional officers and employees"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":128868,"subject_name":"Presidents and presidential powers, Vice Presidents"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1845779,"date":"2019-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB90\/id\/1845779","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr90\/BILLS-116hr90ih.pdf","text_size":130170,"text_hash":"ebd4ea5eb5e891e3396878ce19fbc7d9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
