Under the model, rural hospitals receive fixed, monthly payments from all participating payers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers) for inpatient and outpatient services (rather than on a fee-for-service basis). In order to participate, hospitals must conduct a community health needs assessment survey and submit a transformation plan that incorporates the survey results and includes other specified information relating to the global payment model, including targeted populations, types of services, and anticipated Medicare savings.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-22","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-05-22","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14884,"person_hash":"e685qgbb","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Matthew Cartwright","first_name":"Matthew","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Cartwright","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-PA-17","ftm_eid":15013323,"votesmart_id":136236,"opensecrets_id":"N00034128","knowwho_pid":392004,"ballotpedia":"Matt_Cartwright","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9168,"person_hash":"c40vdlmx","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Young","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AK","ftm_eid":17658637,"votesmart_id":26717,"opensecrets_id":"N00007999","knowwho_pid":158699,"ballotpedia":"Don_Young_(Alaska)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8967,"person_hash":"klyveg3n","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Diana DeGette","first_name":"Diana","middle_name":"","last_name":"DeGette","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-1","ftm_eid":6006202,"votesmart_id":561,"opensecrets_id":"N00006134","knowwho_pid":158770,"ballotpedia":"Diana_DeGette","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
