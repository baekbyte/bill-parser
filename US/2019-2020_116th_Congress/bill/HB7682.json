Specifically, the bill requires the State Department to submit a strategy that includes (1) an articulation of specific U.S. objectives for the political transition in Sudan and a plan to achieve such objectives; (2) an assessment of reforms necessary to promote human rights, essential freedoms, and accountability, as well as a description of efforts to address such reforms; and (3) an assessment of security sector reforms by the Sudanese government, such as demobilizing militias and fostering civilian control of the armed forces. The bill also authorizes the President to provide certain support for (1) democratic governance, rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms; (2) programs to advance economic growth, private-sector productivity, and market-based solutions to development challenges; (3) conflict mitigation strategies to support long-term peace, stability and oversight of Sudanese security and intelligence services; and (4) accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The President must impose sanctions on individuals who the President determines are committing human rights abuses, exploiting natural resources, or undermining the political transition in Sudan. Upon certification that Sudan has taken steps to improve fiscal transparency, the Department of the Treasury and the State Department must engage with international financial institutions to restructure, reschedule, or cancel the sovereign debt of Sudan. During the transitional period in Sudan, Treasury may also support the use of certain funds to respond to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak in Sudan.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-20","committee_id":2305,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Foreign Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-20","action":"Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committees on the Judiciary, and Financial Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8970,"person_hash":"7kmcyqxq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Eliot Engel","first_name":"Eliot","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Engel","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-16","ftm_eid":17658812,"votesmart_id":26972,"opensecrets_id":"N00001003","knowwho_pid":158986,"ballotpedia":"Eliot_Engel","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9192,"person_hash":"77p1skl0","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael McCaul","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"McCaul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-10","ftm_eid":15456789,"votesmart_id":49210,"opensecrets_id":"N00026460","knowwho_pid":226551,"ballotpedia":"Michael_McCaul","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11302,"person_hash":"u4x9bn35","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Bass","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-37","ftm_eid":22511,"votesmart_id":28963,"opensecrets_id":"N00031877","knowwho_pid":226476,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Bass","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9160,"person_hash":"o1zhlthv","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James McGovern","first_name":"James","middle_name":"P.","last_name":"McGovern","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-2","ftm_eid":17658594,"votesmart_id":552,"opensecrets_id":"N00000179","knowwho_pid":158877,"ballotpedia":"James_J._McGovern","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15204,"person_hash":"ksrih99k","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Kildee","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"Kildee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-5","ftm_eid":520771,"votesmart_id":136102,"opensecrets_id":"N00033395","knowwho_pid":294255,"ballotpedia":"Dan_Kildee","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9078,"person_hash":"7ingxztp","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Barbara Lee","first_name":"Barbara","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CA-13","ftm_eid":1263932,"votesmart_id":8315,"opensecrets_id":"N00008046","knowwho_pid":158726,"ballotpedia":"Barbara_Lee_(California)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20125,"person_hash":"7akvxmtj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Michael San Nicolas","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.
