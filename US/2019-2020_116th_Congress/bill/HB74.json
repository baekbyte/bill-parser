The bill transfers release authority from DOJ to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS may release the alien to an appropriate authority for proceedings related to the arrest, but DHS must resume custody for any period that the alien is not in such authority's custody. If the alien is not convicted of crimes for which the alien was arrested, DHS must continue to detain the alien until removal proceedings are completed. DHS must complete the removal proceedings within 90 days.","pending_committee_id":3994,"committee":{"committee_id":3994,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Immigration and
