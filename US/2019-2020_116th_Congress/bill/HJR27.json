It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and ends the partial government shutdown that began after the existing CR expired on December 21, 2018, because seven of the remaining FY2019 appropriations bills have not been enacted. (Five of the FY2019 appropriations bills were enacted last year, including the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019; the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019; the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2019; and the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019.) Additionally, the CR has the effect of extending through February 1, 2019, several authorities and programs that were extended in prior CRs, including the Violence Against Women Act, the authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to collect and spend certain fees related to pesticides, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and several authorities related to immigration.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-14","committee_id":2298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-14","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-14","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Appropriations.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-01-15","action":"Mrs. Lowey moved to suspend the rules and pass the resolution.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-15","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
