The Department of the Treasury shall impose asset-related sanctions on persons that knowingly provide significant financial services to any person that is subject to various sanctions, including those covered in any United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution. The President may impose sanctions on persons that take certain actions related to North Korea, including knowingly (1) engaging in transactions in goods such as coal, or (2) contributing to a violation of a UNSC resolution through a significant transfer of property. A country that has transacted in defense articles with North Korea shall be barred from receiving certain U.S. assistance for five years, whereas currently the prohibition lasts for two years. The President's annual report to Congress on the implementation of UNSC resolutions shall include information on countries that fail to prohibit certain activities related to North Korea, such as the unauthorized clearing of funds. The bill also imposes various reporting requirements, such as requirements for Treasury to report on how North Korea's government exploits beneficial ownership rules to access the international financial system. The bill authorizes each state to adopt measures to require the divestment of the state's assets from North Korea-related investments. Treasury shall designate an office to coordinate efforts to combat the illicit financing of human trafficking. The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking shall report to Congress recommendations for strengthening anti-money-laundering efforts in relation to human trafficking.","pending_committee_id":2321,"committee":{"committee_id":2321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Banking, Housing, And Urban
