It also establishes a pilot program to provide E-rate support to certain community-serving institutions. First, a tribe may designate a tribal library or tribal library consortium, including a public-serving library of a tribal college or university, as a library or library consortium that is eligible for E-rate support. The tribe may make this designation regardless of whether the library or consortium is eligible for certain assistance from a state library administrative agency. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must establish a program to provide E-rate support to tribes for qualifying essential community-serving institutions (e.g., community centers). E-rate support may be provided to institutions designated by tribes if (1) the institutions are exclusively owned by the tribes; and (2) the institutions intend to deliver publicly available internet access to students, teachers, librarians, and community members. Further, the bill requires the FCC to (1) provide technical assistance and training, (2) develop performance measures, and (3) review and submit annual reports.","pending_committee_id":2335,"committee":{"committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-08-13","committee_id":2335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Indian Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-08-13","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16505,"person_hash":"h55o4gz6","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martha McSally","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"McSally","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AZ","ftm_eid":17657675,"votesmart_id":137299,"opensecrets_id":"N00033982","knowwho_pid":401802,"ballotpedia":"Martha_McSally","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9491,"person_hash":"isieh7x3","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lisa Murkowski","first_name":"Lisa","middle_name":"","last_name":"Murkowski","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-AK","ftm_eid":6604204,"votesmart_id":15841,"opensecrets_id":"N00026050","knowwho_pid":192554,"ballotpedia":"Lisa_Murkowski","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7973","sast_bill_id":1375559}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13377,"subject_name":"Native Americans"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13534,"subject_name":"Educational technology and distance education"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13389,"subject_name":"Libraries and archives"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13288,"subject_name":"Telecommunication rates and fees"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2207661,"date":"2020-09-08","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4529\/id\/2207661","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4529\/BILLS-116s4529is.pdf","text_size":308896,"text_hash":"f8e833c929e016c7fb56abe5193e2a73"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
