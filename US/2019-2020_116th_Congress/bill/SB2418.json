Specifically, the bill increases the revenue Gulf states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) receive from certain federal oil and leases in the Gulf of Mexico and eliminates the revenue sharing cap; exempts from sequestration payments of such revenue to Gulf states; allocates revenue from energy development in the Alaska OCS to Alaska for specified purposes, including mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources; and eliminates the 2% fee that the federal government currently deducts from a state's share to cover administrative or other costs.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-01","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-07","action":"Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
