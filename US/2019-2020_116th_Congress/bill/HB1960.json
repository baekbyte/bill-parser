Beginning in 2019, crude oil refineries, petroleum importers, coal mines, coal importers, and natural gas suppliers or processors must purchase carbon permits equivalent to the amount of CO2 that would be emitted by covered fuels. establishes a declining cap on the quantity of permits issued to reduce CO2 emissions until 2040 when the permits issued represent an amount 80% below 2005 CO2 emission levels. provides for the trading or sale of permits between entities, the banking by entities of permits for future years, and the borrowing by Treasury of permits from future years to stabilize permit prices. Auction proceeds and penalties are returned to U.S. citizens lawfully present in the United States using the Healthy Climate Trust Fund established by this bill. Treasury must impose fees on the import and pay fees for the export of carbon-intensive goods when the export country does not have equivalent measures to regulate greenhouse gases. Carbon-intensive goods are goods with an increased cost due to the regulation of greenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection Agency must regulate within 10 years all sources of greenhouse gases that are anthropogenically emitted. This excludes gases attributable to the production of animals for food.","pending_committee_id":4135,"committee":{"committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-03-28","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},{"date":"2019-03-29","committee_id":4135,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Environment and Climate Change"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-28","action":"Referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-03-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16488,"person_hash":"g9uiscjq","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Beyer","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Beyer","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-8","ftm_eid":1579842,"votesmart_id":1707,"opensecrets_id":"N00036018","knowwho_pid":487540,"ballotpedia":"Don_Beyer","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB940","sast_bill_id":1246534}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13330,"subject_name":"Environmental protection"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13131,"subject_name":"Air quality"},{"subject_id":13322,"subject_name":"Civil actions and liability"},{"subject_id":21500,"subject_name":"Climate change and greenhouse gases"},{"subject_id":13690,"subject_name":"Coal"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13182,"subject_name":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"},{"subject_id":13641,"subject_name":"Environmental regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13424,"subject_name":"International law and treaties"},{"subject_id":13232,"subject_name":"International organizations and cooperation"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13619,"subject_name":"Mining"},{"subject_id":13256,"subject_name":"Oil and gas"},{"subject_id":13426,"subject_name":"Pollution liability"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13678,"subject_name":"Tariffs"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1992872,"date":"2019-04-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB1960\/id\/1992872","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr1960\/BILLS-116hr1960ih.pdf","text_size":323796,"text_hash":"2df018205618168442beaed47eb0b737"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
