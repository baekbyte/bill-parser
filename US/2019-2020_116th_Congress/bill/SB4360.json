It also establishes a grant program to replace sworn law enforcement officers in schools with personnel and services that support mental health and trauma-informed services. Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds to hire, maintain, or train sworn law enforcement officers in elementary or secondary schools, preschools, or programs based in elementary or secondary schools. Further, it prohibits the use of public safety and community policing grants for sworn law enforcement officers who operate in and around elementary and secondary schools. Additionally, the bill directs the Department of Education to award grants to local educational agencies to (1) replace sworn law enforcement officers in elementary and secondary schools with personnel and services that support mental health and trauma-informed services, and (2) reform school safety and disciplinary policies to reflect evidence-based practices that do not rely on the criminal justice system. A recipient must use grants funds to carry out certain activities, such as hiring or training specified staff, implementing trauma-informed services, and providing professional development to teachers and staff. It prohibits the use of grant funds for (1) establishing or enforcing zero-tolerance school discipline policies, (2) purchasing or installing surveillance equipment (e.g., metal detectors), or (3) arming teachers or other school personnel.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-07-29","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-07-29","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8986,"person_hash":"m2pvngcc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Murphy","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Murphy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":6384200,"votesmart_id":17189,"opensecrets_id":"N00027566","knowwho_pid":193324,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15350,"person_hash":"18701e4h","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Elizabeth Warren","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Warren","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MA","ftm_eid":1789719,"votesmart_id":141272,"opensecrets_id":"N00033492","knowwho_pid":309189,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Warren","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB7848","sast_bill_id":1374841}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13142,"subject_name":"Child health"},{"subject_id":13594,"subject_name":"Contracts and agency"},{"subject_id":13374,"subject_name":"Criminal justice information and records"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":81063,"subject_name":"Educational guidance"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13176,"subject_name":"Employment and training programs"},{"subject_id":13341,"subject_name":"Firearms and explosives"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13236,"subject_name":"Law enforcement administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13469,"subject_name":"Law enforcement officers"},{"subject_id":13314,"subject_name":"Mental health"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13730,"subject_name":"Nursing"},{"subject_id":13721,"subject_name":"School administration"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":81062,"subject_name":"Student records"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2205486,"date":"2020-08-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB4360\/id\/2205486","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s4360\/BILLS-116s4360is.pdf","text_size":321721,"text_hash":"7474c404acab802f364ccc368c5e5054"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
