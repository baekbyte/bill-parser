Loans under these programs are not eligible for the federal public service loan forgiveness program. The repayment program offers a single repayment plan that caps annual debt repayments based on the borrower's income. The Department of Education (ED) must provide an online tool to enable borrowers to make payments and access specified details regarding loans. The bill provides ED with access to information in the National Directory of New Hires to identify when borrowers are hired and remind them of their repayment status and obligation to provide accurate employment information. The bill requires (1) the total amount deducted and withheld under the IDEA Loan Repayment Program to be reported on W-2 forms, and (2) the Department of the Treasury to disclose to ED tax return information necessary to carry out the IDEA Loan Repayment Program.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16482,"person_hash":"09m0eusv","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lee Zeldin","first_name":"Lee","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zeldin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-1","ftm_eid":6684704,"votesmart_id":110252,"opensecrets_id":"N00029404","knowwho_pid":267328,"ballotpedia":"Lee_Zeldin","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":20685,"subject_name":"Employee hiring"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13230,"subject_name":"Interest, dividends, interest rates"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049040,"date":"2019-08-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB4079\/id\/2049040","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr4079\/BILLS-116hr4079ih.pdf","text_size":438389,"text_hash":"67ba1a8f99114006b8848d1fdda3010a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
