The bill expands DHS responsibilities through grants and cooperative agreements, including provision of assistance and education related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures and cybersecurity technologies, cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings. The bill requires the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to coordinate with entities such as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center to (1) conduct exercises, (2) provide operational and technical cybersecurity training, and (3) promote cybersecurity education and awareness.
