Specifically, the bill extends the program through August 15, 2020, and it allows a loan recipient to select any eight-week period within the program's duration to use their loan. The bill also prohibits the Small Business Administration from requiring a paycheck protection loan recipient to use at least 50% of loan amounts for payroll costs. Further, the bill defers payment of applicable employment taxes for a paycheck protection loan recipient that has had loan amounts forgiven. Currently, a taxpayer that has had loan amounts forgiven is ineligible for such deferral.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-06-01","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-06-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21467,"person_hash":"b5vz9rek","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kelly Loeffler","first_name":"Kelly","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loeffler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-GA","ftm_eid":6803079,"votesmart_id":188718,"opensecrets_id":"N00046125","knowwho_pid":724457,"ballotpedia":"Kelly_Loeffler","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2199520,"date":"2020-07-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB3859\/id\/2199520","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s3859\/BILLS-116s3859is.pdf","text_size":304258,"text_hash":"3093c9fbbfd512a959f17a3c14f92b4d"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
