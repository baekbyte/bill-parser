Specifically, the bill (1) eliminates the standards, assessments, and academic accountability requirements for state and local educational agencies that receive federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children, (2) requires such funds to be allocated based on the number of children residing in each state who are living in poverty, and (3) allows educational agencies to distribute per-pupil amounts from such funds to parents for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses. The bill prohibits federal officers or employees from mandating academic standards, assessments, curricula, or accountability systems.","pending_committee_id":3789,"committee":{"committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-01-03","committee_id":3789,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Education and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-01-03","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18291,"person_hash":"3fg4gjfb","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Andy Biggs","first_name":"Andy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Biggs","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AZ-5","ftm_eid":6602301,"votesmart_id":28088,"opensecrets_id":"N00039293","knowwho_pid":212155,"ballotpedia":"Andy_Biggs","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9368,"person_hash":"pv8v5nzy","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Doug Lamborn","first_name":"Doug","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lamborn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CO-5","ftm_eid":6368620,"votesmart_id":2698,"opensecrets_id":"N00028133","knowwho_pid":193118,"ballotpedia":"Doug_Lamborn","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13125,"subject_name":"Academic performance and assessments"},{"subject_id":13170,"subject_name":"Education of the disadvantaged"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13174,"subject_name":"Elementary and secondary education"},{"subject_id":13287,"subject_name":"Teaching, teachers, curricula"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":1846890,"date":"2019-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB69\/id\/1846890","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr69\/BILLS-116hr69ih.pdf","text_size":250301,"text_hash":"7fe2b09e6584746ccff5f927a2316a91"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
