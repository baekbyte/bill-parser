Specifically, the bill allows a dependent of such a servicemember to terminate such a lease during the one-year period following the servicemember's death. Under current law, only the servicemember's spouse may do so. Current law also allows the spouse of such a servicemember to terminate such a lease during the one-year period after the servicemember incurs a catastrophic illness or injury. The bill specifies that this authority applies only if the servicemember lacks the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs; otherwise, the servicemember, but not the spouse, may terminate the lease during the one-year period.","pending_committee_id":2333,"committee":{"committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-04-10","committee_id":2316,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"},{"date":"2019-04-29","committee_id":2598,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity"},{"date":"2020-02-27","committee_id":2333,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Veterans' Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-04-10","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-04-29","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended) by Voice Vote.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Mr. Takano moved to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-02-25","action":"Considered under suspension of the rules.
