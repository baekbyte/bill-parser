HHS may apply civil monetary penalties to health insurers that fail to comply with a corrective action taken by HHS and may decertify the plan as a qualified health plan. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, the only plans eligible for premium subsidies, and meet the requirements for minimum essential coverage.) HHS must determine whether HHS or the state will undertake the corrective actions based on whether the state can adequately undertake the actions. The bill declares that the review by HHS of unreasonable increases in premiums does not prohibit a state from imposing on health insurers additional rate requirements that are more protective of consumers. The HHS review, which currently covers only premium increases, is expanded to include all rate increases.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-09","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-09","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-09","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8988,"person_hash":"2vo8uaxr","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Janice Schakowsky","first_name":"Janice","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Schakowsky","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-9","ftm_eid":6419995,"votesmart_id":6387,"opensecrets_id":"N00004724","knowwho_pid":158836,"ballotpedia":"Jan_Schakowsky","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2463","sast_bill_id":1256105},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1261","sast_bill_id":1256042},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB1425","sast_bill_id":1227365}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13323,"subject_name":"Disability and health-based discrimination"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13487,"subject_name":"Insurance industry and regulation"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2172653,"date":"2020-03-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6136\/id\/2172653","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6136\/BILLS-116hr6136ih.pdf","text_size":323995,"text_hash":"3416590429787d995cb4f457276b7ac1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
