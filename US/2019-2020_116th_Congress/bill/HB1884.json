Specifically, the bill increases premium assistance for low-income households and specifies that the coverage affordability requirements for employer-sponsored plans extend to family members of employees based on the employee's required contribution as a percentage of the employee's income. Further, the bill prohibits specified agency actions that would weaken the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) with respect to (1) association health plans; (2) short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans; and (3) state applications to waive certain PPACA provisions. The bill also increases the minimum coverage requirements for private health insurance plans and requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promote the availability of such plans. The health coverage navigator program also is revised to prioritize community and consumer-focused nonprofits and facilitate enrollment in federally supported insurance programs such as Medicaid. The bill establishes a fund for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to provide cost assistance to individuals who are enrolled in qualified health plans.Additionally, the bill provides new and additional grant funding for states to (1) plan and establish health insurance exchanges, (2) provide consumer assistance about available health insurance plans and coverage, and (3) increase health insurance plan enrollment. HHS also must report on the annual expenditure of user fees collected through federally facilitated exchanges.","pending_committee_id":2355,"committee":{"committee_id":2355,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on
