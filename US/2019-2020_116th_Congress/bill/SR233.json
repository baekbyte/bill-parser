Specifically, it recognizes that free speech zones and restrictive speech codes of institutions of higher education are inherently at odds with the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. In addition, the resolution urges (1) IHEs to facilitate and recommit themselves to protecting the free and open exchange of ideas; (2) the Department of Education to promote policies that foster debate, academic freedom, intellectual curiosity, and viewpoint diversity on campuses of public IHEs; and (3) the Department of Justice to defend and protect the First Amendment across public IHEs.","pending_committee_id":2330,"committee":{"committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-05","committee_id":2330,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-05","action":"Referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
