It requires that if a member of the Armed Forces who is required to receive a physical examination upon separation from active duty and has or is believed to have a medical condition that may make the member eligible for veterans' disability compensation and benefits, the examination must be performed by a VA-certified health care provider. If the condition is discovered during the physical examination and the examining health care provider is not VA-certified, the examination must be completed by a VA-certified provider. An eligibility determination made as part of such an examination shall be binding on the VA and be used as the basis for assigning the member's disability rating. The VA and DOD shall jointly establish a system to share data and maintain the medical and personnel records of Armed Forces members and veterans.","pending_committee_id":2597,"committee":{"committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-05-21","committee_id":2299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Armed Services"},{"date":"2019-05-22","committee_id":2361,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Military Personnel"},{"date":"2019-06-11","committee_id":2597,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-21","action":"Referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-05-22","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-06-11","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9389,"person_hash":"8gue0k26","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Wittman","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Wittman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-1","ftm_eid":6666723,"votesmart_id":58133,"opensecrets_id":"N00029459","knowwho_pid":241260,"ballotpedia":"Rob_Wittman","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13163,"subject_name":"Department of Veterans Affairs"},{"subject_id":13166,"subject_name":"Disability and paralysis"},{"subject_id":13385,"subject_name":"Disability assistance"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13313,"subject_name":"Medical tests and diagnostic methods"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13888,"subject_name":"Personnel records"},{"subject_id":13295,"subject_name":"Veterans' medical care"},{"subject_id":13362,"subject_name":"Veterans' pensions and compensation"},{"subject_id":13358,"subject_name":"Armed forces and national security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2035384,"date":"2019-06-06","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB2886\/id\/2035384","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr2886\/BILLS-116hr2886ih.pdf","text_size":362237,"text_hash":"9e083dd84d91c2c70b538a36b95ac459"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
