ARPA-Terra must award grants to institutions of higher education and other entities to achieve its goals, including to accelerate early-stage research on agricultural technologies. ARPA-Terra must also implement agriculture technology projects that identify and promote revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences; translate scientific discoveries and cutting-edge inventions into technological innovations; and accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that, due to technical and financial uncertainty, industry is not likely to undertake without federal assistance.","pending_committee_id":2318,"committee":{"committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-10-29","committee_id":2318,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Agriculture, Nutrition, And Forestry"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-10-29","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9463,"person_hash":"ldf3b0fy","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Michael Bennet","first_name":"Michael","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Bennet","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-CO","ftm_eid":5995587,"votesmart_id":110942,"opensecrets_id":"N00030608","knowwho_pid":274906,"ballotpedia":"Michael_Bennet","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8986,"person_hash":"m2pvngcc","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Christopher Murphy","first_name":"Christopher","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Murphy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-5","ftm_eid":6384200,"votesmart_id":17189,"opensecrets_id":"N00027566","knowwho_pid":193324,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Murphy_(Connecticut)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4902","sast_bill_id":1278552}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13597,"subject_name":"Agriculture and food"},{"subject_id":13400,"subject_name":"Advanced technology and technological innovations"},{"subject_id":13130,"subject_name":"Agricultural research"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13151,"subject_name":"Department of Agriculture"},{"subject_id":13184,"subject_name":"Executive agency funding and structure"},{"subject_id":13737,"subject_name":"Federal officials"},{"subject_id":13198,"subject_name":"Government employee pay, benefits, personnel management"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13658,"subject_name":"Technology transfer and commercialization"},{"subject_id":13612,"subject_name":"Agricultural trade"},{"subject_id":13332,"subject_name":"Atmospheric science and weather"},{"subject_id":13452,"subject_name":"Competitiveness, trade promotion, trade deficits"},{"subject_id":13169,"subject_name":"Economic performance and conditions"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13203,"subject_name":"Government trust funds"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13272,"subject_name":"Rural conditions and development"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2060111,"date":"2019-11-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2732\/id\/2060111","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2732\/BILLS-116s2732is.pdf","text_size":345749,"text_hash":"0badf9f354553eda51cf8b2dab29caea"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
