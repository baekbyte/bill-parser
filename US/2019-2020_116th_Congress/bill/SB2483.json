No U.S. agency or department may arrest an individual based solely on an INTERPOL notice without (1) prior validation of the individual's eligibility for extradition, (2) a diplomatic request for arrest from the requesting country, and (3) an arrest warrant. A U.S. agency or department may not use an INTERPOL communication from an INTERPOL member country that does not have a bilateral extradition treaty with the United States as the sole basis for certain actions, such as detaining an individual or denying an individual a visa, without verifying that the communication likely comports with INTERPOL's constitution. The bill requires reports on countries that abuse INTERPOL communications for political motives and other unlawful purposes.","pending_committee_id":2327,"committee":{"committee_id":2327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Foreign
