The bill requires that $1 billion of program funds not otherwise obligated or expended be set aside for loan guarantees made by minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions. Further, for any future appropriations to carry out the program, the bill revises the amounts that the Small Business Administration (SBA) must set aside to provide for the cost of guaranteed paycheck protection loans made by certain lenders. The SBA and the Department of the Treasury must, no less than twice weekly, provide separate eight-hour periods during which they shall process (1) loan applications compiled by lenders with consolidated assets of less than $1 million, and (2) loan applications for less than $200,000 from a recipient that has 20 or fewer employees. The SBA and Treasury must report on funds made available to lenders and community development financial institutions to carry out the Paycheck Protection Program and the total consolidated assets of each lender. For future appropriations to carry out the program, the SBA and Treasury must report (1) daily on the amount of funds not yet obligated or expended, and (2) weekly on the amount of funds made available to lenders and community development financial institutions and the total consolidated assets of each lender.","pending_committee_id":2314,"committee":{"committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-05-08","committee_id":2314,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Small Business"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-05-08","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Small Business.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20062,"person_hash":"7x1uts8s","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sylvia Garcia","first_name":"Sylvia","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garcia","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-TX-29","ftm_eid":16351467,"votesmart_id":49734,"opensecrets_id":"N00042282","knowwho_pid":454041,"ballotpedia":"Sylvia_Garcia","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13134,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":13497,"subject_name":"Bank accounts, deposits, capital"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13479,"subject_name":"Credit and credit markets"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":13219,"subject_name":"Housing and community development funding"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13848,"subject_name":"Minority and disadvantaged businesses"},{"subject_id":13276,"subject_name":"Small business"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":21946,"subject_name":"Business expenses"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2187669,"date":"2020-05-23","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6758\/id\/2187669","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6758\/BILLS-116hr6758ih.pdf","text_size":316125,"text_hash":"afa286465a00525fc4a76fbda36e3853"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
