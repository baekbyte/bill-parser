The bill expresses the sense of Congress that Native American tribes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan are sovereign governments and retain certain rights to regulate natural resources used by their members on tribal lands and public lands on reservations. In addition, the bill urges Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan to consult early and fully with each affected tribal government when drafting state wolf management plans.","pending_committee_id":3992,"committee":{"committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-25","committee_id":2310,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Natural Resources"},{"date":"2019-10-03","committee_id":3992,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-09-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-10-03","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9154,"person_hash":"0gala4ad","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Collin Peterson","first_name":"Collin","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Peterson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-7","ftm_eid":16588347,"votesmart_id":26926,"opensecrets_id":"N00004558","knowwho_pid":158917,"ballotpedia":"Collin_Peterson","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20108,"person_hash":"1zy2f82t","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Pete Stauber","first_name":"Pete","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stauber","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MN-8","ftm_eid":44044791,"votesmart_id":159954,"opensecrets_id":"N00041511","knowwho_pid":630211,"ballotpedia":"Pete_Stauber","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9232,"person_hash":"aiyghgq9","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"James Sensenbrenner","first_name":"F.
