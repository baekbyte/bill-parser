Specifically, it applies the requirements for processing information reasonably linkable to a young consumer or child to any entity within the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, including nonprofit organizations.Additionally, the bill modifies the requirements for such processed information with respect to obtaining verifiable consent to process such information and the applicable exceptions; developing a publicly available privacy policy with respect to such information; consumers' access to, and requests to delete, such information; and securing such information and periodically testing such security measures. Among other things, it also adds provisions requiring the deletion of processed information that is no longer reasonably necessary to retain for the purpose for which it was processed, prohibiting targeted marketing to a specific young consumer or child based on processed information or using processed information in a manner inconsistent with the reasonable expectation of such consumers, and limiting the disclosure of processed information to third parties without a written agreement with the third party specifying and limiting the purposes for which the third party may process the information and requiring the third party to provide specified security and privacy protections.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-01-29","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-01-29","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8963,"person_hash":"lghvcrvx","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kathy Castor","first_name":"Kathy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Castor","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-FL-14","ftm_eid":170335,"votesmart_id":53825,"opensecrets_id":"N00027514","knowwho_pid":248289,"ballotpedia":"Kathy_Castor","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16485,"person_hash":"0vtl1zss","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bonnie Coleman","first_name":"Bonnie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NJ-12","ftm_eid":6389632,"votesmart_id":24799,"opensecrets_id":"N00036158","knowwho_pid":362925,"ballotpedia":"Bonnie_Watson_Coleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9167,"person_hash":"aaq2jux5","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Tonko","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Tonko","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NY-20","ftm_eid":4469600,"votesmart_id":4403,"opensecrets_id":"N00030196","knowwho_pid":197757,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Tonko","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16502,"person_hash":"fwdilijo","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Debbie Dingell","first_name":"Debbie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dingell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MI-12","ftm_eid":252193,"votesmart_id":152482,"opensecrets_id":"N00036149","knowwho_pid":357079,"ballotpedia":"Debbie_Dingell","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16498,"person_hash":"etwlc6gj","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Seth Moulton","first_name":"Seth","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moulton","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-MA-6","ftm_eid":25004670,"votesmart_id":146299,"opensecrets_id":"N00035431","knowwho_pid":464944,"ballotpedia":"Seth_Moulton","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18316,"person_hash":"kvbno8r6","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Raja Krishnamoorthi","first_name":"Raja","middle_name":"","last_name":"Krishnamoorthi","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-IL-8","ftm_eid":6265333,"votesmart_id":117519,"opensecrets_id":"N00033240","knowwho_pid":385662,"ballotpedia":"Raja_Krishnamoorthi","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13376,"subject_name":"Child safety and welfare"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13514,"subject_name":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC)"},{"subject_id":13309,"subject_name":"Fraud offenses and financial crimes"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13639,"subject_name":"Marketing and advertising"},{"subject_id":13270,"subject_name":"Right of privacy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2117001,"date":"2020-01-30","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB5703\/id\/2117001","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr5703\/BILLS-116hr5703ih.pdf","text_size":372125,"text_hash":"4865103c14a9220537d545253d1bdd6f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
