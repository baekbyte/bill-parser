Clean distributed energy means energy (e.g., solar and wind energy) that is generated on or near customer sites and interconnected with the electric grid. Specifically, DOE must study the status of integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids, identify issues requiring additional research or regulatory development, make grants for research proposals that address technical barriers identified in the study, establish and distribute to states best practices to encourage the integration of clean distributed energy into the grid, and convene a working group of stakeholders to address regulatory barriers to deployment of intelligent grid integration of clean distributed energy technologies. DOE may make grants to implement integration demonstration projects.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-08-01","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-08-01","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9422,"person_hash":"cleoh36j","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeanne Shaheen","first_name":"Jeanne","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shaheen","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-NH","ftm_eid":2227644,"votesmart_id":1663,"opensecrets_id":"N00024790","knowwho_pid":209675,"ballotpedia":"Jeanne_Shaheen","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13127,"subject_name":"Advisory bodies"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":20565,"subject_name":"Computer security and identity theft"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13180,"subject_name":"Energy efficiency and conservation"},{"subject_id":13181,"subject_name":"Energy research"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13474,"subject_name":"Public utilities and utility rates"},{"subject_id":13267,"subject_name":"Research administration and funding"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2049241,"date":"2019-08-16","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2422\/id\/2049241","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2422\/BILLS-116s2422is.pdf","text_size":369763,"text_hash":"16db4f2c7431bd5d029c24c3286367e9"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
