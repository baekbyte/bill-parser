Specifically, the bill replaces the expected family contribution metric with a student aid index used to assess a family's financial need and approximate their financial resources to contribute to a student's higher education expenses. The bill also revises the process for filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and it removes certain eligibility requirements related to drug-related offenses and registration with the Selective Service System. The bill reauthorizes the Pell Grant program through FY2021, establishes a new eligibility formula for Pell Grants, and increases the maximum Pell Grant award. The Department of Education (ED) must conduct certain activities to educate students and their families about Pell Grant eligibility at a younger age. In addition, the bill expands Pell Grant eligibility to (1) certain incarcerated individuals; and (2) students enrolled in short-term programs that provide training in high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations. ED must develop a standard terminology and format for financial aid offers, which shall provide certain information such as costs, grant and scholarship aid, annual net price, work-study, loans, and accepting or declining aid. In addition, the bill provides that a borrower on a 10-year standard loan repayment plan shall not be subject to a maximum monthly payment or any other maximum monthly payment. Further, the bill makes funding for historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions permanent.","pending_committee_id":2328,"committee":{"committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-26","committee_id":2328,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-26","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9428,"person_hash":"9owmjihh","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Lamar Alexander","first_name":"Lamar","middle_name":"","last_name":"Alexander","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-TN","ftm_eid":2116345,"votesmart_id":15691,"opensecrets_id":"N00009888","knowwho_pid":211704,"ballotpedia":"Lamar_Alexander","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2321","sast_bill_id":1251948},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB888","sast_bill_id":1245808},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB2667","sast_bill_id":1277523}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13329,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":13126,"subject_name":"Administrative law and regulatory procedures"},{"subject_id":13348,"subject_name":"Adoption and foster care"},{"subject_id":13133,"subject_name":"American Samoa"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13147,"subject_name":"Consumer affairs"},{"subject_id":13433,"subject_name":"Correctional facilities and imprisonment"},{"subject_id":13154,"subject_name":"Department of Education"},{"subject_id":13171,"subject_name":"Education programs funding"},{"subject_id":13178,"subject_name":"Employment taxes"},{"subject_id":13470,"subject_name":"Family relationships"},{"subject_id":13872,"subject_name":"Financial literacy"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13202,"subject_name":"Government lending and loan guarantees"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13204,"subject_name":"Guam"},{"subject_id":13215,"subject_name":"Higher education"},{"subject_id":13217,"subject_name":"Homelessness and emergency shelter"},{"subject_id":13408,"subject_name":"Human trafficking"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13488,"subject_name":"Marriage and family status"},{"subject_id":13796,"subject_name":"Marshall Islands"},{"subject_id":13797,"subject_name":"Micronesia"},{"subject_id":13484,"subject_name":"Military personnel and dependents"},{"subject_id":13635,"subject_name":"Minority education"},{"subject_id":13255,"subject_name":"Northern Mariana Islands"},{"subject_id":13799,"subject_name":"Oceania"},{"subject_id":13800,"subject_name":"Palau"},{"subject_id":13263,"subject_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"subject_id":13475,"subject_name":"Refugees, asylum, displaced persons"},{"subject_id":13339,"subject_name":"State and local taxation"},{"subject_id":13286,"subject_name":"Student aid and college costs"},{"subject_id":13319,"subject_name":"Tax administration and collection, taxpayers"},{"subject_id":13801,"subject_name":"Temporary and part-time employment"},{"subject_id":13491,"subject_name":"U.S. territories and protectorates"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"},{"subject_id":13294,"subject_name":"Veterans' education, employment, rehabilitation"},{"subject_id":13297,"subject_name":"Wages and earnings"},{"subject_id":13489,"subject_name":"Caribbean area"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2055949,"date":"2019-10-04","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2557\/id\/2055949","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2557\/BILLS-116s2557is.pdf","text_size":607463,"text_hash":"9f857a094b65d385aa2c549e6df74f40"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
