Specifically, the bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants to states to create insulin card programs, which provide uninsured or underinsured individuals with insulin at no cost for specified time periods. Payments for insulin prescriptions made through the program must count toward an underinsured individual\u2019s health plan deductible. Further, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must collect annual fees from insulin manufacturers, based on each manufacturer\u2019s market share, equal to the total estimated expenditures under the insulin grants program. Subject to certain exceptions, the bill also establishes an excise tax on insulin manufacturers when the price of an insulin product spikes. The tax amount is a specified percentage of the revenue a manufacturer received as a result of the price spike. The tax amount increases in tiers based on the percentage of the price spike for that product.","pending_committee_id":2326,"committee":{"committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-06-27","committee_id":2326,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-06-27","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19499,"person_hash":"xk4y3m3y","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Tina Smith","first_name":"Tina","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-MN","ftm_eid":4173995,"votesmart_id":152968,"opensecrets_id":"N00042353","knowwho_pid":332335,"ballotpedia":"Tina_Smith","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":14888,"person_hash":"00ti0jne","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Kevin Cramer","first_name":"Kevin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cramer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ND","ftm_eid":13010662,"votesmart_id":444,"opensecrets_id":"N00004614","knowwho_pid":240471,"ballotpedia":"Kevin_Cramer","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB4010","sast_bill_id":1272113}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13510,"subject_name":"Accounting and auditing"},{"subject_id":13768,"subject_name":"Business ethics"},{"subject_id":13413,"subject_name":"Business records"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13673,"subject_name":"Digestive and metabolic diseases"},{"subject_id":13200,"subject_name":"Government information and archives"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13207,"subject_name":"Health care coverage and access"},{"subject_id":13210,"subject_name":"Health information and medical records"},{"subject_id":13212,"subject_name":"Health programs administration and funding"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13228,"subject_name":"Indian social and development programs"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13231,"subject_name":"Intergovernmental relations"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13701,"subject_name":"Manufacturing"},{"subject_id":13245,"subject_name":"Minority health"},{"subject_id":13258,"subject_name":"Performance measurement"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13671,"subject_name":"Public-private cooperation"},{"subject_id":13523,"subject_name":"Retail and wholesale trades"},{"subject_id":13316,"subject_name":"Sales and excise taxes"},{"subject_id":13284,"subject_name":"State and local finance"},{"subject_id":13285,"subject_name":"State and local government operations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2045183,"date":"2019-07-05","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2004\/id\/2045183","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2004\/BILLS-116s2004is.pdf","text_size":434215,"text_hash":"bbd6705c1ec5838de20da0ece2fedd3f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
