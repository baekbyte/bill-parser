The Lifeline program is designed to reduce the cost of communications services for low-income consumers, and it allows those consumers to qualify for Lifeline assistance based on their receipt of other federal assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid or Federal Public Housing Assistance). Specifically, the FCC must submit reports on (1) enrollment in the Lifeline program by individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program), and (2) the number of new broadband consumers projected to join the Lifeline program through federal assistance programs and the efficacy of various efforts to advertise the Lifeline program.","pending_committee_id":2302,"committee":{"committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-09-29","committee_id":2302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Energy And Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-09-29","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20079,"person_hash":"t8ov15ns","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elaine Luria","first_name":"Elaine","middle_name":"G.","last_name":"Luria","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-2","ftm_eid":45301001,"votesmart_id":179677,"opensecrets_id":"N00042293","knowwho_pid":644669,"ballotpedia":"Elaine_Luria","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20105,"person_hash":"pj9a15df","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Abigail Spanberger","first_name":"Abigail","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spanberger","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-7","ftm_eid":44045205,"votesmart_id":179682,"opensecrets_id":"N00041418","knowwho_pid":630216,"ballotpedia":"Abigail_Spanberger","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":20097,"person_hash":"grn495qr","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Denver Riggleman","first_name":"Denver","middle_name":"","last_name":"Riggleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-VA-5","ftm_eid":37981574,"votesmart_id":181445,"opensecrets_id":"N00043541","knowwho_pid":613877,"ballotpedia":"Denver_Riggleman","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB4131","sast_bill_id":1372375}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13513,"subject_name":"Science, technology, communications"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13190,"subject_name":"Food assistance and relief"},{"subject_id":22688,"subject_name":"Government studies and investigations"},{"subject_id":13233,"subject_name":"Internet and video services"},{"subject_id":13289,"subject_name":"Telephone and wireless communication"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2213509,"date":"2020-10-26","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB8427\/id\/2213509","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr8427\/BILLS-116hr8427ih.pdf","text_size":292432,"text_hash":"8f2f9471900b1a550a3377af876919c2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
