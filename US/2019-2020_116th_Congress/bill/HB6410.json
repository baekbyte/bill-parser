(That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.) The President must (1) make a determination that the ventilators and protective equipment are essential for the national defense; (2) identify private-sector capacity to produce such equipment; and (3) exercise authorities under the act to mitigate, where possible, the dependency of the United States on overseas sources and to ensure the supply of such equipment. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the agency coordinating the response shall submit weekly reports to Congress on the status and distribution of such equipment.","pending_committee_id":2304,"committee":{"committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2020-03-27","committee_id":2304,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Financial Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2020-03-27","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2020-03-27","action":"Referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9077,"person_hash":"3lsd7um3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Larson","first_name":"John","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Larson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-CT-1","ftm_eid":16565470,"votesmart_id":17188,"opensecrets_id":"N00000575","knowwho_pid":158776,"ballotpedia":"John_Larson_(Connecticut)","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB8943","sast_bill_id":1386896}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13304,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":13783,"subject_name":"Cardiovascular and respiratory health"},{"subject_id":13146,"subject_name":"Congressional oversight"},{"subject_id":13308,"subject_name":"Emergency medical services and trauma care"},{"subject_id":13211,"subject_name":"Health personnel"},{"subject_id":13214,"subject_name":"Health technology, devices, supplies"},{"subject_id":13706,"subject_name":"Infectious and parasitic diseases"},{"subject_id":13485,"subject_name":"Military procurement, research, weapons development"},{"subject_id":13260,"subject_name":"Public contracts and procurement"},{"subject_id":13468,"subject_name":"Worker safety and health"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2178849,"date":"2020-04-15","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB6410\/id\/2178849","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr6410\/BILLS-116hr6410ih.pdf","text_size":314262,"text_hash":"781d50edd22384b1f5be6ca43053b368"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
