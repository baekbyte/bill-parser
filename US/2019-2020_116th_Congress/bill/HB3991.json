(A biologic drug is produced through natural processes or isolated from natural sources. A biosimilar version is substantially similar to the original biologic, which is the reference product, and is often marketed as a less expensive alternative.) The bill's provisions apply to an existing framework that gives the biosimilar manufacturer an abbreviated path to Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the biosimilar. Specifically, if the biosimilar manufacturer completes certain actions under the framework, such as sharing certain information about its product with the reference product manufacturer, the bill limits the number of certain patents that the reference product manufacturer may assert in a lawsuit, such as patents that were filed more than four years after the reference product received market approval. The limit shall not apply to patents claiming certain methods for using the biologic drug. The court in which the infringement lawsuit is filed may increase the limit if justice so requires or if there is good cause for the increase.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2019-07-25","committee_id":2309,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2019-08-28","committee_id":2852,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"name":"Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, And The Internet"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-07-25","action":"Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-08-28","action":"Referred to the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1},{"date":"2019-11-19","action":"Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Discharged.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":0},{"date":"2019-11-21","action":"Ordered to be Reported (Amended).","chamber":"H","chamber_id":114,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8976,"person_hash":"rffp6oz3","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Henry Johnson","first_name":"Henry","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Johnson","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Hank","district":"HD-GA-4","ftm_eid":17658662,"votesmart_id":68070,"opensecrets_id":"N00027848","knowwho_pid":248293,"ballotpedia":"Hank_Johnson","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11163,"person_hash":"kuapkzdj","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Martha Roby","first_name":"Martha","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roby","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-AL-2","ftm_eid":17657350,"votesmart_id":71604,"opensecrets_id":"N00030768","knowwho_pid":283894,"ballotpedia":"Martha_Roby","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"SB1416","sast_bill_id":1259904},{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB2486","sast_bill_id":1256475}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13637,"subject_name":"Commerce"},{"subject_id":13642,"subject_name":"Competition and antitrust"},{"subject_id":13206,"subject_name":"Health care costs and insurance"},{"subject_id":13493,"subject_name":"Inflation and prices"},{"subject_id":13614,"subject_name":"Intellectual property"},{"subject_id":13418,"subject_name":"Judicial review and appeals"},{"subject_id":13490,"subject_name":"Prescription drugs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2048870,"date":"2019-08-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/HB3991\/id\/2048870","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/hr3991\/BILLS-116hr3991ih.pdf","text_size":240877,"text_hash":"39d98f7164b540928a7aebab3250f571"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2019-11-20","time":"10:00","location":"2141 RHOB","description":"House Committee on the Judiciary Hearing"}]}}
