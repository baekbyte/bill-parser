The bill defines such systems as equipment or materials installed in, on, or near a building to support onsite or local energy use, such as solar energy, batteries, and charging systems for electrical vehicles. Specifically, the Department of Energy (DOE) must establish or designate a Distributed Energy Opportunity Board to carry out a voluntary program to (1) expedite the process for local permitting and inspection of qualifying distributed energy systems, and (2) facilitate the certification of distributed energy system installers. In addition, DOE must recognize and certify communities as Distributed Energy Opportunity Communities if they adopt and implement a permit-to-build protocol that is established by the board. DOE may award grants to encourage communities to adopt the protocol and standardized inspection processes established by the board.","pending_committee_id":2324,"committee":{"committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2019-09-09","committee_id":2324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"name":"Energy And Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2019-09-09","action":"Read twice and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":115,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":9057,"person_hash":"xtyb5c1g","party_id":"1","state_id":52,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Martin Heinrich","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heinrich","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-NM-1","ftm_eid":8939798,"votesmart_id":74517,"opensecrets_id":"N00029835","knowwho_pid":266934,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Heinrich","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":9459,"person_hash":"f0qn5jvf","party_id":"2","state_id":52,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Collins","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Collins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-ME","ftm_eid":10045641,"votesmart_id":379,"opensecrets_id":"N00000491","knowwho_pid":165234,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Collins_(Maine)","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":8,"type":"Related","sast_bill_number":"HB5335","sast_bill_id":1287171}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":13399,"subject_name":"Energy"},{"subject_id":13132,"subject_name":"Alternative and renewable resources"},{"subject_id":13681,"subject_name":"Building construction"},{"subject_id":13173,"subject_name":"Electric power generation and transmission"},{"subject_id":13520,"subject_name":"Energy storage, supplies, demand"},{"subject_id":13519,"subject_name":"Hybrid, electric, and advanced technology vehicles"},{"subject_id":13312,"subject_name":"Licensing and registrations"},{"subject_id":13280,"subject_name":"Social work, volunteer service, charitable organizations"},{"subject_id":13738,"subject_name":"Tax-exempt organizations"},{"subject_id":13648,"subject_name":"User charges and fees"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2053077,"date":"2019-09-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/text\/SB2447\/id\/2053077","state_link":"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/bills\/s2447\/BILLS-116s2447is.pdf","text_size":359289,"text_hash":"bdd16a6119d39d523d3da6b4b7fdd0de"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
